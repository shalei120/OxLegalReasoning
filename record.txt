**clear** **,** **burnished** **copper-brown** **topped** **by** **a** **large** **beige** **head** **that** **displays** **impressive** **persistance** **and** **leaves** **a** small to **moderate** **amount** **of** **lace** **in** **sheets** when it eventually departs the nose is sweet and spicy and the flavor is malty sweet , accented nicely by honey and by abundant caramel/toffee notes . there 's some spiciness ( especially cinnamon ) , but it 's not overdone the finish contains a moderate amount of bitterness and a trace of alcohol . the mouthfeel is exemplary ; full and rich , very creamy . mouthfilling with some mouthcoating as well . drinkability is high . great lakes christmas ale is my first beer from the best brewery in my home state of ohio and my former residence ( 3 years ) of cleveland . i 'm very impressed . i expected a good , solid christmas beer and those expectations were met and exceeded by a long shot . i only got a single this year , but you can bet that i 'll be getting more of this fine seasonal during my future trips home for the holidays . i would have no trouble at all drinking christmas ale year-round .
picked this up in totowa since i never tried it before and this is prime season for this **type** **of** beer . while it was **n't** **anything** bad , this may have been the most 'plain jane ' **hefe** that i 've ever had one of **most** **plain** **beers** overall . it 's by no means a **drain** **pour** **like** **the** **mass-market** **macros** would be for me but there was n't anything memorable about this either standard pour to this **with** **an** off-gold **hue** **and** **lots** **of** **cloudiness** to it **.** **the** **head** reminded me of **soda** based on the sound and how long it lasted - lots of fizzle with little substance . there was **n't** **any** lacing to be seen and for the most part , that was the taste too . lots of starch like potato chips or crackers with just a hint of clove , bubble gum , and banana here . nowhere near as pronounced as its german counterparts and the aftertaste could hardly be detected either . just a bit of carbonation here too but nothing that detracted from the beer itself sure , it 's a bigger bottle but this was easy to down and if i had another , i might have opened that too afterwards . i came in with no expectations and left feeling the same way - not quite 'blah ' and not impressed either . i would n't mind giving other beers from these guys a go , if for no other reason to see if this brewery is middle of the road on all of their offerings . this is only worth a try if nothing else in this style is readily available .
**very** **dark** **beer** **.** **pours** **a** **nice** **finger** **and** **a** **half** **of** **creamy** **foam** **and** **stays** throughout the beer . smells of coffee and roasted malt . has a major coffee-like taste with hints of chocolate . if you like black coffee , you will love this porter . creamy smooth mouthfeel and definitely gets smoother on the palate once it warms . it 's an ok porter but i feel there are much better one 's out there .
**poured** into a snifter **.** **produces** **a** **small** **coffee** **head** **that** **reduces** **quickly** . **black** as night . pretty typical imp . roasted malts hit on the nose . a little sweet chocolate follows . big roasty character on the taste . in between i 'm getting plenty of dark chocolate and some bitter espresso . it finishes with hop bitterness . nice smooth mouthfeel with perfect carbonation for the style . overall a nice stout i would love to have again , maybe with some age on it .
**a** **very** **underrated** **ipa** **pours** **a** **coppery/burnt** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **big** **head** **that** **lasts** quite some time . taste is hoppy , with loads of pine-y bitterness , but also citrus flavors including grapefruit and ... is that a hint of tropical flavor ? maybe some pineapple . you see some nice malt/hop balance in quite a few of the better dipas , but this is one of the few ipas that 's both quite hoppy and well balanced superb mouthfeel and drinkability . ballast point continues to rise in my estimation with every offering i consume .
**poured** from a 24oz bottle into a large **sniffter** appearance : **this** **pours** **a** **deep** **bronze** **amber** **in** **color** . this beer has some of the **best** **head** formation **and** retention that i have ever seen along with lots and **lots** **of** **sticky** **lacing** smell : tons of piney resinous evergreen aroms abound in this ale . cant get enough of this beer its the best smelling harvest ale i 've ever had the pleasure of enjoying taste : huge flavor profile with lots of bitterness and only a little malt sweetness . as this beer warms up the bitterness really dominates the flavor . i 'm tasting lot of subtle orange aromas mouthfeel : full body beer with alot of carbonation overall : i love this beer in my opinion its serria nevada 's best beer overall . the price is unbeatable i bought my bombed for $ 3.99 . so much flavor and biting bitterness this harvest ale has no equal .
**poured** from a 12oz bottle into a delirium **tremens** glass . this is so hard to find in columbus for some reason , but i was able to get it in toledo **...** **murky** **yellow** **appearance** **with** **a** **very** **thin** **white** **head** . the aroma is bready and a little sour . the flavor is really complex , with at least the following tastes : wheat , spicy hops , bread , bananas , and a toasty after-taste . it was really outstanding . i 'd recommend this to anyone , go out and try it . i think it 's the best so far from this brewery .
thanks to tenderbranson69 for sharing this bottle , poured chilled into a willybecker a - **a** **very** **hazy** **dark** **amber** **w/** **2.5** **fingers** **of** **rocky** **light** **tan** **head** **,** **thick** **lace** **collects** **on** **the** **glass** **like** **webbing** s - a strong sweet fruit like candied citrus and honeyed pineapple w/ a hint of mango and papaya w/ a subtle green tea tinge like herbs w/ a gentle grape/lemony acidic nose m - the feel is delightful and not at all what you would expect considering the fruit filled aroma - not overly sweet . the texture is aided by tingling carbonation and mild juicy fruity notes w/ light sweet and nutty/woody earthy tinges and mild acidity w/ a semi-sweet finish . the astringent aspect is mild w/ alcohol only noted in very slight ways t - a lot of tropical fruit and white grapeskin flavor like gooseberry w/ a mild pineapple and sweet pine w/ herbs , tea and lychee w/ a hint of mango . the flavor is accented by sweet but not syrupy malt that accompanies a mild pear and pine taste w/ very very light minty clean elements . the taste of citrus is there but enveloped by papaya and passionfruit w/ an alcohol flavor and resinous slightly bitter finish . the finish is semi-dry w/ a refreshing flavor -more than any other single hop ale i have had . d - i found the taste of this to be like fruit in peculiar fresh hoppy aspects w/ great drinkability and bitter/sweet blend which is intensely packed with nelson sauvin hop goodness - juicy and delicious .
**pours** **a** **nice** **golden** **color** **with** **very** **little** **head** **and** **almost** **no** **lacing** . smells of caramel malt and a very floral hop nose tastes like it smells fairly bitter but well balanced m : good carbonation and helps the bitterness take shape . d : very good ipa , not the best by far , but a solid example , i keep expecting and recieving great beers from samuel smith
**well** , it 's **not** really a **kriek** , and **not** really a flander 's **red** **either** -- somewhere in between . the beer base is a stanard sour belgian beer with tart berry notes , hints of vineous and woodiness and a hint of funk . the body lacks the firm malt base for a flanders , but not candy-sweet enough for a kriek but does show subtle character of both . a mild malt base struggles to support the sourness and cherry flavors but does keep the beer from complete astringency and thinness . hops are light , but do show some american citrus notes which i find quite pleasant . somewhat lemony and berry-like to go along with the added fruits . still a fine beer that i enjoyed quite well , but it does n't represent styles well -- let 's just call it a belgian sour beer with cherries added .
**i** **really** **did** **not** like this . it just seemed **extremely** **watery** . **i** **dont** ' think this had any carbonation **whatsoever** . maybe it was flat , who knows ? but even if i got a bad brew i do n't see how this would possibly be something i 'd get time and time again . i could taste the hops towards the middle , but the beer got pretty **nasty** towards the bottom . i would never drink this again , unless it was free . i 'm kind of upset i bought this .
poured chilled ( 50 degree f ) into a pint glass , it **pours** **the** **color** **of** **honey** with **a** **cloudy** , honey-like body . **about** **1** **finger** **thick** **of** **eggshell** **colored** **head** **sits** **atop** the body but then **dissipates** to a surface layer with just a bit **of** **lacing** around the edge of the glass . aroma is quite mild . some slight malt hits the nose , but by hitting i mean hitting like 'a girl ' flavor is quite sweet malt with a nice hoppiness coming through on the finish to help balance it . however , this is mostly watery and not very flavorful body is a little chewy for a pilsner , but thirst quenching and quite easy to drink . i would n't drink this if i wanted to drink something with boisterous taste , but i 'd drink it for hours on a hot summer day .
**appearance** : **why** is it characterized as 'jet ' **black** **?** **like** , this stuff is **black** , but how does that equate to a **jet** **smell** : very roasty and a little bit of earthy hops . coffee , and chocolate . taste : coffee , chocolate , and a slightly estery yeast flavour . mouthfeel : smooth is such a generic term . this beer is **small-bubbled** and delicious . there 's definitely a lot of hops that were thrown in the boil . drinkability : much like their java , the alcohol is there in intoxication , but almost absent in taste and aroma . this makes it excessively easy to drink . the bitterness makes it a little charcoal-y but holy crap , what an incredible beer . overall : i 'm happy with this beer , but way too expensive . over $ 10 per bottle , i 'd probably rather have a brooklyn black chocolate stout . they 're extremely similar , but this stuff is really nice .
**clear** **copper** **colored** **brew** **,** **medium** **cream** **colored** **head** . floral hop nose , caramel malt . caramel malt front dominated by a nice floral hop backround . grapefruit tones . very tasty hops run the show with this brew . thin to medium mouth . not a bad choice if you 're looking for a nice hop treat .
**pours** **a** **dark** **brown** **,** **almost** **black** **color** **.** **there** **is** **minimal** head that goes away almost immediately with **only** **a** **little** **lacing** . smell is a little subdued . dark coffee malts are the main smell with a slight bit of hops also . taste is mostly of coffee with a little dark chocolate . it starts sweets , but ends with the dry espresso taste . mouthfeel is thick and chewy like a stout should be , but i prefer a smoother feel . drinkability is nice . a very good representation for its style .
bottle at kerstbier tasting at the shack . **a** **-** **pours** **orange-bronze** **,** **with** **a** **2** **fingered** **head** **that** **dissipates** **slow** **.** **nice** **lacing** left in the glass . s - cloves , ginger , dark belgian sugars , and spicy hops . t - the same above , but add in light alcohol . m - still a little thin , but balalnced mouthfeel . d - good , but could have more viscous to support the mouthfeel .
**this** one came **off** **the** **tap** **a** **golden** **color** **with** **hints** of amber in there as well with a **good** **coat** **of** **head** over top . the nose was sweet swet caramel with some of that lager nose i have yet to put into words . it smells nice . the flavor is not bad , with a good caramel backbone supporting a piney hop background . not bad at all . i 'd have another if i were back .
**a** **:** **a** **nice** **ruby** **color** **with** **a** **2** **finger** **off** **white** **head** **.** **with** **lacing** s : a wonderful , citrusy hop smell along with caramel malt and some piney-ness t : it has a nice maltiness , but is still bitter . you can definitely taste the hops . it is bitter and piney , and has some citrus in the middle . there is a nice bitterness in the end . it is sticky and coats the mouth m : it has a nice medium mouth feel . and it coats the mouth a little d : it is a good dipa , and i could see myself drinking this again . a great addition to texas ' selection on a side note : i dominated a windsor knot while drinking this , so if you cant tie a tie , drink this and you will be able to .
served on tap **in** **a** **pint** **glass** **,** **this** **is** **an** **absolutely** **clear** **golden** **straw** **color** **with** **big** **fomay** **white** **head** **with** **decent** **retention** and **tons** of carbonation bubbles . nose is pretty faint , some grassy hops , a little malt , nothing else . taste is a sharp spicey hop over a light grainy malt -- very melded together , not much going on , but satisfying . as the beer warmed some slight lemony flavors crept in . bodies on the thin side , but it has a nice carbonation and a great crisp finish . overall this is a solid pils , nothing to write home about , but definitely a good offering that you can find at a decent number of bars .
**a** **very** **solid** **brew** . i did like this one **pours** **a** **light** **brown** **color** **,** **minimal** **head** **,** **good** **lacing** . smells like must and roasted grain tastes like roasted grain with some malty goodness medium mouthfeel that makes you want more . drinkability is very decent , could have a few .
**i** **was** **handed** **a** glass of **this** **unusual** beer at a small **party** this evening and i was told it was something special from belgium . i put my nose to it right away to ascertain it values after being told it was a lambic . i thought the fragrances of tart apples and fruit were going to knock me out or at least scare me away from enjoying it . the first taste was a very spicy and tart flavor that made me question , like many other belgian beers i had tasted recently , was this made from apples and hard **cider** . i put the glass down to taste the home brewed version of poor richard 's i had made with great success . it 's smooth sweet flavor contrasted well with the lambic which i thought may have needed more time to settle . i remarked that while this could be found at whole foods , i did n't think it would be served in shea stadium anytime soon as one needed a lot of time to go over it to find its reason of being .
**this** **was** **light** **copper** **in** **color** **and** **had** **a** **huge** **golden** **foam** . it lasted quite awhile . **the** **foam** left huge **...** **big** **hunks** **of** **lacing** all down the glass . it was quite clear..no yeast in bottle . the aroma was rich with malt ... and hoppy . the taste was fairly hoppy , but not overbearing . there was a lot of maltiness to balance it . the carbonation was good and it was fairly thin bodied . it was pretty damned drinkable ... yummy i might say .
**1** **1/2** **finger** **head** **with** **excellent** **retention** **.** **nice** **amber** **color** **.** **retention** **sticks** around for almost the entire experience . smell is a little faint and only floral notes come out . it 's hard to pick apart . taste is nicely balanced . malty caramel and pale malts upfront mix with a piney citrusy bitterness in the back . not over the top in bitterness , but a hop fix with a nice malt backbone . crisp and very smooth mouthfeel . very full on the palate . this beer was very easy to drink and was quite well balanced . i could make a session of it easily .
**very** **dark** **and** **opaque** **with** **a** **nice** **light** **tan** **head** **,** **incredibly** **foamy** **and** **beautiful** **to** **look** **at** **.** **lacing** is present , but not very consistent . smell is exquisite , extreme coffee grounds , espresso and roasted malts . i pick up bits of burnt wood in the background and a little chocolate , even whiffs of oatmeal , wonderful aroma . taste is quite understandably coffee grounds , however not as dominantly as i would assume . the coffee blends fairly well alongside milk chocolate , dark chocolate , and espresso . there is also some molasses-sweetness and a chocolaty aftertaste . medium to full bodied , but quite smooth with alcohol completely hidden . it would be hard to drink several of these due to the infusion of coffee , but something i would drink again . i 'd even recommend this to coffee-haters thanks to its balance .
( served in an american pint glass **)** **a-** **this** **beer** **has** **a** **hazy** **lemon** **yellow** **body** **with** **a** **snow** **white** **head** **that** **fades** after a bit . the body is a bit too dense to see much carbonation s- this beer has a light tartness with a faint lemon zest note to it . there is a light dryness to the smell at the finish . t- this beer has a smooth dry soft wheat flavor with a nice soft pine note and citrus zest note at the end . as the beer warms there is a nice dry spice warmth that taste faintly of coriander m- this beer has a light mouthfeel and a clean finish d- this beer has a nice dry yet fruity crisp taste to it that overs a nice refreshing change from so many bland wit beer . the dryness with some complexity and the light body make this beer pretty quaftable .
11.2 oz bottle split and poured into a new belgium globe . 4.3 % abv , 4°c - 6°c , 40199 on label . **a** **-** **faintly** **cloudy** **pink** **in** **color** **with** **a** **dense** **white** **head** **.** **frilly** **lace** **drapes** across the glass delicately . s - fresh bushels of raspberries just rinsed gives the aroma an inviting nose . soft wheat and lemonade pull through and 'fake-up ' the aroma . it almost begins smelling like a berry weiss-sunset wheat combo . initially good though ... t - fruity raspberry is far too syrupy with a lingering corn syrup finish . light wheat in the background balanced just a bit but it 's overly fake in it 's flavor profile . it almost seems as if lemonade is blended in . m - sugary sweet and slight with a highly carbonated finish and light body . o - overly sweet and fake , it 's got a good aroma initially but definitely lacking elsewhere . too syrupy but not awful .
another new one ( as of this date ) from anacapa . and **a** good addition **to** **boot** **orangy** **body** **with** **a** **smallish** **white** **head** **.** smells a little fruity , like orange maybe . i can definitely smell the hops too . tastes of hops mainly and some orange in there as well . mainly it 's a bitterness that hits your tongue . it 's not overwhelming by any means , it 's just the main flavor/feel on the tongue . a light medium mouthfeel to this one . pretty darn drinkable , especially on a hot so cal summer day . this is a great beach day sipper .
pint served at brewery . made with bohemian pilsner malts , nobel hops , and 2 german hops . ibu = **23** **pale** **golden** **with** **1** **finger** **pure** **white** **head** **;** **head** **has** **moderate** **retention** ; medium-high carbonation visible . s - czech style malt with hop background t - clean ; nice pilsner finish m - smooth and a bit sparkling ; light and watery
**appearance** **-** **darkish** **deep** **amber** **orange** **color** **that** is **very** **cloudy** . pours **about** **an** **inch** **of** **off** **white** **head** **when** **poured** **violently** **.** **head** **quickly** **dissipates** into a **thin** film **that** **leaves** **hardly** **any** **lacing** . not too unexpected with the style and gravity . smell - dark fruits with lots of cherry and plum to start . alcohol is definitely evident , but so are a moderate amount of sweeter hops . maybe a bit of caramel/vanilla scent , something sweet . taste - there is a big sweetness off the bat with this barleywine , that does n't really fade too much . alcohol flavor lasts throughout also , with the same characteristics of the smell here as well . cherry , plum , and raisin dominate the palate . kind of one dimensional in terms of flavors mouthfeel - moderate to high carbonation , with a pretty viscous and thick coat left on the tongue overall - i feel like this is a slightly better than average beer . i do n't have too much to compare it to stylewise , but i will say that you know how much alcohol you 're taking in while drinking this . southern tier does not normally disappoint , and they did n't necessarily here either , but they also did n't really excite me either .
12oz bottle split **with** onix1agr **.** **a-** **pours** **black** **with** **mahogany** **edges** **.** **nice** **small** **cap** **of** **coffee** **colored** **dense** **and** **creamy** **head** **that** **settles** **to** **a** **faint** **ring** and some small islands of fizz . s- goobs of bourbon and dark roasted almost burnt malts . port and molasses , booze soaked blackberries , brown sugar t- well the bourbon takes the lead and never gives it up , this is not to say that its all booze . lots of some of the roastiest malts this tongue has ever come across and a blackstrap molasses sweetness . port soaked dark fruit and bruleed brown sugar on top . the wood plays a nice earthy role and adds some faint vanilla m- medium to light body and about he same in carb . i remember this being thicker and lively but this is a well aged bottle of a huge brew . i really like how the barrel imparts almost a wood grain texture to the mouthfeel . long linger . d- well its not an every day kind of beer , hell its not even a whole bottle kind of beer , but that being said this stuff is super complex and a true whiskey bomb . not for the faint of heart but if you like em from the barrel this one is for you .
**poured** into **snifter** **glass** **a** **:** **rich** **golden** **amber** **hue** **,** **finger** **of** **so** **of** **head** **that** **dissipated** **somewhat** **quickly** s : wonderful tripel nose . the alcohol is there but hints of fruit . i caught tones of apple and possibly cherry in the nose . i really enjoyed the nose on the beer . t & m : wow this is a tart tripel . the one the thing on the taste that i noted was the strong hints of cherry . the finish is so dry but is very pleasant . mouthfeel is tart as well , leaves hints of that with aftertaste . d : drinkable but high abv would prevent more than one or two in a sitting . i am a tripel fan and this moves up on top of the list with la fin du monde .
12 oz bottle poured into **duvel** tulip . bottle reads 'ale brewed with chamomile flowers ' - i do n't think i 've ever had chamomile in anything but tea , so i 'm not sure what to expect pour is **a** **crisp** **gold** **color** **with** **some** **haze** **,** **1** **finger** **head** **quickly** **dissipates** **leaving** **no** **lacing** . aroma is subdued wheat with some banana and a few other fruits i ca n't place ; there is n't much to the nose at all . there is n't a lot going on with the first sip - more than anything else it comes across with a crisp finish . maybe i do n't know what to look for with the chamomile , but i ca n't taste it at all . mouthfeel is much more interesting - it 's medium-bodied and a bit creamy , but leaves a distinctly clean and refreshing feeling on my palette after each sip . definitely a good choice for a hot summer afternoon outside . overall there is n't a lot to this beer , but i think that 's just fine . i 'd describe this as a lawnmower beer , but one that you would n't have any qualms about reaching into the cooler for again and again .
**ah** **...** time for dessert . acquired this at the local trader joes for $ 4.99 a 4-pack . **poured** **black** **as** **tar** **with** **a** **medium** **brown** **head** **that** **lasted** longer than i thought considering the style . the aroma was of chocolate , coffee , cherries and alcohol . the taste was bittersweet . dark chocolate , roasted malt , a bit of molasses all balanced by a spicy hop aftertaste that lingered rather nicely . this beer got more complex as it warmed with a smokiness and hints of currant and licorice . finishes dry with a definite alcohol warming . quite the tasty morsel and exceptional for the price . get thee down to your local tj 's and stock up
**pours** **a** **deep** **dark** **black** **with** **a** **firm** **offwhite** **head** **about** **a** **half** **inch** **thick** **leaving** **a** **tiny** **lace** . aromas are of chocolate and roasted malts , along with some alcohol and a little dark fruit as well ( maybe even some courants ) . for taste this beer starts off initially with its big strong malts showing off some bittersweet chocolate , and a nice roasty flavor with almost a little smoke intertwined in there . following some of the dark fruits shine through with almost a bit of tart sourness , but those flavors are quickly overwhelmed by more dark malts and a little coffee . this beer finishes smooth with a nice bitter hop finish that lingers on the tongue . a nice full body to this beer with a like carbonation and full flavor makes this beer a classic .
**a** **:** **pours** **a** **lot** **darker** that i thought it would and that was a pleasant surprise . this is a **jet** **black** **beer** **with** **a** **pretty** **dark** **head** s : wonderful smell of roasted malts , chocolate , little bit of java , and beautiful blueberries . t : i was very impressed with this beer . i usually am not a big fan of fruit flavors in beer , but this beer was definetly an exception . the blueberries were never overwhelming , and were definetly an awesome touch to this stout m : it was a little bit thinner than i thought it would be . d : honestly i could drink these all day . especially good for this time of year . this was my first dark horse brew and i will definetly be looking for more .
**another** **great** beer from hoppymeal , poured into a snifter . this one is really **dark** **,** **pitch** **black** with **an** **aggressive** **pour** **producing** **a** **short-lived** **tan** **head** **that** **recedes** **very** **quickly** to a **small** **ring** . there 's **not** **much** lacing , but there are boozy legs lining the glass after each sip . aroma is definitely boozy with some heavily roasted dark chocolate malts and dark fruits . caramelized sugar and licorise lend a bit of sweetness to things . there seems to be a smoked character to the aroma as well the taste is sweet with lots of licorice and molasses before the burnt malts take over in the middle . the finish is dry and boozy with a lingering bitterness from the charred malts . the mouthfeel is heavy and slick with very little carbonation . this is definitely a sipper and a good beer , but it 's definitely not in the top tier of impy stouts . the drinkability is always going to be limited with an 18 % abv but it 's not completely overpowering on the palate .
**when** **wheat** **beers** and lighter **bock** **beers** meet , we 're given a unique blend of malt depth , fruity esters , and elevated alcoholic strength . upon the decant , **the** **beer** **delivers** **a** **beautiful** **golden-amber** **color** **and** **a** **magnificent** **bright** **appearance** **.** **creamy** **head** **character** **of** **stark** **white** **foam** **laces** with a lot of **decorative** patterns on the glasss . **impressive** appearance overall . malty aromas of bread crust , elegant pilsner malt , light toffee , and a rich bready flavor of fresh baked breads along with caramelized grains carry a vibrant and fresh aroma . a contribution of herbal tea-like hops give a light floral note to the rich malt scents . delicious and with a lot of finess when considering the malt profile . though strong in alcoholic taste , the firm maltiness delivers a mild toffee taste along with a lot of melanoidin flavors of bread crust , savory caramelization , and succulent fresh bread flavors . with just enough herbal and floral hop flavor to decorate the peripheries of malt flavor and with the slightest offset from sweetness , the beer shies away from sweetness in favor of true malt flavor in finish . sweetness is lightly amplified by the fruity/floral flavors of orange blossem , apple pie , and marmelade . creamy and a bit oily from the focus of malt richness and wheat , the beer carries a consistent texture from early creaminess through late fullness until the strength of alchol breaks apart the beer and allows for an alcoholic semi-dry finish . a hint of oily feel comes out of the toffee-buttery note and may offer the slightest of distractions . the rich and savory melanoidin notes of the beer definately set it appart from other beers of it 's type that do n't take as much care . but the oily malt character offers just a slight flaw in taste and texture .
**a-** **poured** **to** **a** **light** **yellow** **color** **,** that had **a** **white** head that didnt last long . had a little i **mean** **little** **lacing** . s- smelled a little like bananas and citrus . there wasnt a lot of smell here period . t- there really wasnt a lot of taste . just a little taste of bananas . then again , a very little taste . almost like drinking water . m- felt like water in the mouth . i thought the carbonation was a little too much . d- i wont buy these again . there wasnt any flavor that you would crave . berghoff really makes some good beers . this isnt one of them .
12 ounce can dated 12256 poured at **43** **degrees** **with** **slight** **head** **that** **did** **not** **have** **much** **retention** **.** **clear** **,** **pale** and **watery** with a few small bubbles . unable to detect any malt or hops watered down taste of a cold lager . nothing off but not able to describe anything exciting . this is more drinkable in the summer when a good light thirst quencher might be needed .
brought home a bottle of six pack of this when we went down to pittsburgh to see the sox . we can thank ale street news for the brewpubs locations in pa . great place for a slight detour on my birthday on the way into pittsburgh **.** **appearance** **:** **hazy** **orange** **color** **with** **a** decent amount of carbonation . **slight** head that has remained in the pint glass . smell : slight piney hop profile and bigger caramel malts are the only thing that comes out to me . also get some slight hints of grapefruit . the beer could use a better hop profile since the malts take over the majority of the aroma . taste : piney , malty , and citrus/grapefruit notes on the palate . the ingredients fit the style fine , but could have a cleaner taste that is more noticeable mouthfeel : slightly smooth , a little chewy , and medium carbonation . overall : not a bad ipa and happy that i was able to try this at the brewpub , bring it to the hotel , and have beers make it all the way back up here to lovely dorchester . if i am ever going to pitt again , this brewpub and beer will be in the agenda . only 20 minutes out of town too .
**poured** **a** **very** **slightly** **hazed** **golden** **orange** into my pint glass **.** **the** **thin** **head** **leaves** **a** **swiss** **cheese** **like** **lace** on the glass . the aroma is musty , floral and sweet  like a flowery meadow . some fruitiness and dark nuttiness . intriguing aroma . the taste is very appealing . accent on the hoppy with the malt bringing up a close second . there 's a grapefruit rind bitterness in the finish . a fine and flavorful ipa .
**pours** **a** **rather** **crisp** **yellow** **almost** **orange** **with** **a** **thin** **head** . the aroma is dominated by sweet malts with just a slight hoppiness dancing in the background . the taste does have a surprising amount of hoppiness for a pilsner . there is a good maltiness to it as well , but citrus hops just slightly overpower . the beer is very light and refreshing . this makes for an excellent summer session beer .
i picked up this bottle in greenville sc a few weeks **ago** **.** **the** **beer** **is** **dark** **yellow** **orange** **color** **,** a little **hazy** **,** **with** **a** **thin** **head** . this has more of a spicy tripel aroma than ipa . i 've had several beers of this tripel/ipa blend variety and have n't really been taken by any of them . this is turning out to be much of the same , with less ipa and more tripel in the smell and taste . well done for what it is i guess , but not something i 'd search for again .
**poures** **a** **light** **clear** **straw** **,** **with** **a** **one** **finger** **white** **head** **,** **decent** **lacing** clings to the glass . i thought it should be a little more hazy . grass , wheat malt , citrus . not too typical for the style , more of a wheat flavor than a hefeweizen . wheat malt and some citrus flavor light to medium bodied , nice carbonation . this was a decent brew , not my favorite by any means but i would drink this one again . nothing special .
**pours** **a** **dark** **amber** **color** **with** **decent** **head** that does not recede much . it 's a tad too dark to see the carbonation , but fairs well . smells of roasted malts and mouthfeel is quite strong in the sense that you can get a good taste of it before you even swallow . there is a slight dryness to the aftertaste with a nice ballance of hops . there is also a good nutty malt taste too . this is the second ayinger i 've tried after celebrator doppelbock . this is n't quite as good as that , but it 's still up there . i give this a thumbs up .
**a** **-** **dark** **brown** **with** **a** **crimson** **tint** . out of the tap , only a **tiny** head and there was **no** **lacing** . s - slightly dark coffee aroma with a touch of molasses . t - dark malt mostly , a mild sweet chocolate meshed with a much stronger burnt flavor . a mild grassy/citrusy hop taste is there as well . aftertaste is short lived burnt flavor . m - smooth , refreshing , slick , no complaints here . d - easy to drink . since abc always has about 10 different beers on tap , it is likely that i wo n't have this again , i 'd rather try the others , but i would n't mind having this again . nothing spectacular , but certainly enjoyable .
`` another new england gem courtesy of bkett01 . '' thanks **again** **,** **brian** **pours** **a** **hazy** **,** **unfiltered** **looking** **burnt** **gold** . a little paler than most ipa 's , i think . smells like a hop field , there 's no two ways about it . fresh grassy green scent with an undercurrent of spiciness . hop taste starts with a citrusy bite , escalates further into spicy grass notes , and rounds out into brick-solid bitterness . just when the ride looks over , some malt creeps in to provide a little balance . very nice beer here , one i would love to have available on a regular basis . now i want to try the rest of smuttynose 's line , to see how they compare .
**pours** **a** **rich** **viscous** **black** **with** **a** **creamy** **tan** **head** **that** patiently gives way to a **thin** **,** **but** **sticky** **lacing** . aroma consists of opulent roasted malts and milk chocolate , both of which become more pronounced as the beer warms . there may be some wood-like hop notes buried as well . tasty flavor of malt , chocolate , and wood with earthy hops and a touch of booziness as the beer warms . the wood aspects re-appear at the finish with more hop bitterness and a hint of the sweet chocolate . this beer is thick and palate coating with medium carbonation and quite a kick to it between the alcohol , roasted malt , and wood hops . this is one of the heavier beers i have had in a while , and even a bit so stylistically speaking , however the aromas and flavors are quite enjoyable making a a good beer .
650 ml bottle , uk import , trade with maeib . abv is 5.3 % **.** **very** **dark** **opaque** **brown** **colour** **,** **nearly** **black** **.** **pours** **with** **a** **large** **and** **thick** **tan** **head** **.** pleasant roasty aroma with strong coffee notes , also cigarbox , chocolate and leather . flavour has strong coffee notes too , some tar and a slight smokiness . roasty and hoppy bitterness in the long aftertaste . maybe not the most complex beer in the world , but a very good one all the same
**now** quaffing : arcadia batch # 999 'hop fueled ' my first offering from **arcadia** **.** **pours** **a** **hazed** **sepia** **with** a good amount of yeast sediment peppered throughout . carbonation is mild and the does **n't** stick around **long** **.** **lacing** is sticky and has no problems remaining after each sip . aromas are an oily pine with a slight sweet floral character . the taste brings forth a nice dose of the resiny pine hops and sweet grapefruit . mouthfeel is fairly full and very slick with each sip -- nice and smooth . each sip finishes somewhat sweet and slightly dry with just a touch of bitterness lingering . i would believe you if you told me this was a hybrid of english and american ipa styles , as the hop profile seems to suggest influences from both . i wish i could get more of this one , because its a nice change over some of the sharper domestic ipas and dipas .
**this** **beer** **pours** **a** **cloudy** **pale** **orange** **color** **.** **the** head is **half** **an** **inch** **in** **height** **,** **and** **recedes** **quickly** **into** **sparse** **lacing** . the aroma is of oranges , with a hint of coriander . it is rather weak for the style . the taste is a little fuller and more spicy than the aroma . there is coriander , cardamom , and orange . the mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation , and a chewy texture . overall , this is a decent witbier that i would drink again . i just wish the aroma were n't so airy .
**medium** **brown** **,** **fairly** **clear** and **light** **penetrable** **.** **small** **thin** **ring** **of** **white** **foam** . sweet and rich malt smells . very nutty ( roasted almond , pecan ) with some caramel . rich almond and toffee notes , some bitter cocoa or slight espresso maybe . not as sweet as the nose implies , some dryness and alcohol present . warmingly alcoholic . fairly strong carbonation , medium heavy mouthfeel . pretty drinkable .
**i** tried this at illegal pete **'s** **on** **pearl** st . while visiting **boulder** . **it** **'s** **a** **straw** **yellow** **with** **a** **thin** **white** **head** . crisp and clean with a mild inoffensive flavour . a mild wheat beer to be sure . i tried this on a cold november day and i 'm sure i would have enjoyed this more had it been summertime . to be fair i should try it again as i was more in the mood for a pale ale but my girlfriend wanted to share this with me .
**a** **darkish** **golden** **pour** from tap **with** **a** **small** **white** **lacing** around glass . you ca n't miss the sweet smell . the word snappy fits this beer well . it is a winter warmer but not from the usual alcohol burn . the alcohol is almost completely hidden . the warm comes from the mix of cinnamon , hops , and most of all spiciness . the alcohol must be there because i sure did feel it after finishing the glass .
on **cask** **locally** **pours** **with** **a** **lemony** **yellow** **body** **,** **slightly** **hazy** **.** **think** **creamy** **head** **with** **fair** **retention** smell , fresh grass and citrus . dry hoppy nose , some background biscuit malt taste , crisp hoppy bite , some citrus notes once again , little bit of malt on the finish followed by a huge whack of dry bittering hops , very refreshing on a hot day it really hit the spot , very drinkable ale , perfect as a session beer due to its low abv
**a** **-** **deep** **saturated** **orange** **gold** **.** **very** **nice** **appearance** **.** **a** **soapy** **head** **which** **dissipates** down **quite** **quickly** **leaving** **no** **trace** **of** **any** **head** **.** **no** **lacing** either . light carbonation visible . s - strong ginger and spiced meet honey-like flavors . orange peel spiciness and some mild maltiness . little to no hop aroma . t - ginger and orange flavours dominate an underlying maltiness and very very low hop bitterness m - light and fine carbonation , thin but quite smooth . overly so . d - alot of people are slamming this beer and it is very unconventional , granted but i have tried a few of these fusion , lime/ginger/lemon beers and they have been truly woefull , this is the best by far . still if your expecting a euro pale larger you will be very upset .
**a** **-** **very** **nice** **,** **clear** **,** **dark** **reddish-amber** **color** **.** about one **finger** **of** **somewhat** **thin** **head** **that** **retains** **pretty** **well** **.** **leaves** **pretty** **nice** **lacing** . s - bready malts matched with some citrus hoppiness t - slightly bitter , citrus hoppiness up front with sweet , bread malt in the finish . nicely balanced . m - fairly light bodied , slightly more watery than i generally like , but i guess i should 've expected this from a 4.4 % brew . d - could definitely be a session beer . nice and refreshing , lower on the abv level , and has a nice balance of flavors .
12oz bottle into **nonic** **.** **opaque** **brown** **hue** **with** the **exception** of **some** **ruby** edges at the bottom of the glass . **the** **head** **is** **tan** and thin ( typical for the style ) , **and** **slowly** **settles** **to** **a** **bubbly** **rim** **.** **spotty** **and** **stringy** **lacing** . roasted malts toppped with some sweet chocolate and a little bit of raisin . the raisin is such a typical scent in this style , it 's a good indicator . the overall smell is similar to a stout . the flavor is very complex , ranging from the bitter malts as a base , along with some creamy chocolate and a very light hop bitterness . some molasses is in there as well . full bodied with a slightly high amount of carbonation , giving a bit of a fizz . the finish is the lingering bitter malts . three words on the label sum this one up pretty well : viscous , chocolatey , roasty . i can add : delicious , complex , recommended .
**a** - **this** **beer** **poured** **a** **golden** **orange** **color** **that** **produced** **a** **fluffy** **white** **head** **that** **had** **decent** **retention** and left a **moderate** **amount** **of** **lacing** on the side of the glass s - the aroma produced by this beer were a little bit of caramel malts followed by a beautiful mix of flowery , citrusy mix of hops t - the taste of this beer , is well , hoppy , but it is a crazy mix that it is kind of hard to pull one variety of hop from another , but it is a bitter blast , just hoped for more coherence m - the mouthfeel of this beer had a resiny , medium body and moderate amount of carbonation d - this beer was , in the words of andy reid , 'an inch away from greatness , ' this could be a great beer , with just a little bit more work
**a** **-** **pours** **with** **typical** **beautiful** **nitro-cascade** **,** **settles** out to **crisp** **clear** **pale** **gold** **with** **1** **1/2** **finger** **lasting** **fluffy** **,** **creamy** **head** **,** **decent** **lacing** . s - very light -- clean and slightly metallic with just a trace of sourdough . t - fairly lager-like , though a bit more full . very mild floral hops , biscuit malts , paper pulp , faint sour green apple , and a bit of metallic flavor . grains make a stronger presence in the finish . perhaps not as complex as it sounds . m - light , too thin , with lots of tiny effervescent carbonation . sometimes i have experienced a lasting and unpleasant bitter metallic aftertaste , but it was n't so prevalent in this tasting for whatever reason d - very mild and easy to drink though the aftertaste can be a bit of a turn off . nothing special really , but not bad by any means . kind of like a dumbed down english pale ... i suspect it has gone this direction intentionally over the last couple of decades .
**received** **this** beer from csmiley via review this ! bif **so** a big thank you goes out to him a : **this** **beer** **pours** **a** **beautifully** **clear** **deep** **golden/copper** **color** **with** **a** **1/4** **inch** **white** **head** **that** **recedes** to a **small** **film** **quickly** **.** **nice** **wispy** **lacing** is left on the glass s : nose is of pale malts , touch of caramel and citrus hops . t : taste is very well crafted - not overly hopped and malts do not dominate . taste starts with a nice citrus hop flavoring and quickly moves in to a balanced pale malt and finishes with nice sweet caramel malts m : lighter side of medium body , medium carbonation , crisp and clean body . d : well balanced , very tasty and goes down easily . i really wish this brewery distributed this way as i could drink this one all night
**a-** **an** **aggressive** **pour** **revealed** **a** **small** **head** **with** **lacing** on the bottle and a **little** **retention** s- some malts , nothing really worth noting t- ale like , some malt biscut , a very light amount of nuts m - high carbonation level , kinda thin d- one and done . very light for a brown ale and little to no nut flavor
**the** **beer** **pours** **a** **pitch** **black** **color** **with** **a** **thick** **frothy** **tan** **head** **that** **slowly** **fades** **to** **lacing** . the aroma is good . it appears to have a near perfect malt scent . it 's roasted on one hand . it 's dry and earthy on the other . there 's also a nice chocolate component as well . the taste is good . it has a very nice black malt flavor up front with a big chocolate malt blast and a bit of roasted malt character in the finish . to call it complex is an understatement . the mouthfeel is fine . it is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation . this is a good beer . i 'm not getting a huge roasted character which is standard with export stouts , but this is a delicious beer that 's highly drinkable .
**a** **:** **pours** **a** **copper** **color** **with** **a** **moderate** **head** **and** **decent** **lacing** . s : aroma is primarily citrus with a hint of sweetness . t : flavor of citrus , fresh grain and a bit of malt sweetness . some bitterness and a dry finish . f : fairly light body , crisp and quite smooth . needs a bit more character . o : decent beer , good for a few . nothing really outstanding about this beer , more of an average apa .
**this** is my old man 's **go** to beer . i 've had it several times but have never thoroughly thought about what it was i was drinking so i wanted to give it another **go** . **a-** **pours** **a** **light** **bronze** **color** **brew** **with** **a** **one** **inch** **finger** **head** **that** **disappeared** **quickly** **s-** **nice** malty aroma , nothing too heavy . very little hop note . nothing like other esb 's i 've tried . t- tasting a good blend of caramel and hop bitterness . the hop flavor is the more dominant flavor at the tail . nothing to get real excited about m- malty , light-medium body and very crisp d- very refreshing and clean . this beer would make a great session beer . a very light esb . i will for sure buy this beer again and add it to my round of go-to 's .
a much delayed review of this fine **sessionable** ale from jim at fn . i first had it at redmond 's malt n vine and have subsequently had it at fn headquarters . a low alcohol english bitter is what we have here . sessionable beyond belief . you could go through a growler ( or two ) and still walk the next day . i 'd like to see more breweries attempt session **beers** like this - as long as they have the flavor of this one .
**pours** **opaque** **black** **with** **a** **soda** **like** **fizzy** **brown** **head** . the nose is a good blend of the beer and the barrel . there 's that oak/vanilla/bourbon combo that we all love , but some roast and raisin actually make it through . nice boozy bourbon flavors , and it keeps the integrity of the beer . the body is a bit thinner than i remember the original being , but its still substantial . seems kind of fizzy though . still , this is a ba beer worth bragging about .
**my** **pour** **resulted** **in** **a** **little** **better** **than** **a** **finger** **'s** **worth** **of** **rocky** **,** **medium-tan** **head** **with** **good** **retention** . nose was very malty with a grainy/cereal-like aspect . color was **a** **deep** **reddish-amber** **with** **ne-quality** **clarity** . mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a cereal-like sweetness on the tongue . finish lingered with that same sweet flavor . the reviewer who likened this to a marzen was spot-on . it was okay , at best .
**czechvar** **pours** **a** **golden** **yellow** **with** **a** **fluffy** **white** **head** from a brown twelve ounce bottle . a mild hoppy aroma is present . taste has some grain and some grass flavors . definitely hoppy as well . definitely different from the american namesake . worth a try , if for no other reason , it 's the original budweiser .
**appearance** **:** **the** **pour** **gives** **a** **0.3** **'** **off** **white** **head** . the beer is a clear , **light** **brown** **in** **color** **.** smell : good balance of toasted caramel and grainy malt flavors with a considerable english type hop aroma . some lighter hints of dried fruits such as cherries and apricots . mouthfeel : the carbonation is a lighter medium , and the body medium or so . taste : dominant malt flavors ... slightly toasted and grainy with a moderate sweetness . just a little nutty . dull , grassy ( just a little citrus ) hop flavor with a moderate bitterness . drinkability : pretty drinkable notched as best by april 2006
**wow** **,** **quite** **a** **beer** . **i** had it in a bomber poured into a lovely stine my brother brought me from austria . it poured **a** little on the 'heady ' **side** **and** **the** **head** was so bitter it really pursed my lips . once i got down to the actual beer , it was a difference story . hoppy of course , but now with all the fruit of say a ruination . just a wave of bitterness and a lot of full flavor , almost juicy . but with out the citrus i 'm used to from some ipa 's . i only wish i knew hop varieties well enough to know what is missing . it was nice , but ... .not what i was hoping for . and , well , a bit on the alcoholic side..i 'm still buzzing an hour later .
**pours** **a** **pale** **orange** **with** **a** **quickly** **receding** **tan** **head** **.** **no** **lacing** is left behind . smells of grass , grain , faint spice and malts . tastes sweet like pumpkin pie and spicy , although you have to reach a bit to get to it , as the tastes are not bold at all , and are actually a little weak . mouth-feel is light bodied and it has medium carbonation . just a little more in the taste department and this could be a very good brew . it feels like shipyard knows what they 're doing here , but they 're just holding something back for some reason . oh well .
**pours** **a** **dark** **brown** **color** **with** **two** **fingers** **of** **tan** **head** **that** **had** **good** **retention** **.** **the** **head** **eventually** **settles** **to** **a** **thick** **cap** **.** **just** **a** **little** **spotty** **lacing** is left on the glass . has a complex aroma . i smell chocolate , vanilla , roasted nuts , and some dark fruit . i really enjoyed the flavor of this beer as well . for a beer packing 10 % abv , i did not detect any alcohol aroma or flavor . what i did taste is the nutty malt with some chocolate , vanilla , and a little fruitiness in the finish . i also get some ash or charcoal in the aftertaste . this is a really well put together brown ale . the body is on the lighter side of medium . the carbonation is well suited for the body . the only thing that hurts drinkability is the high abv . i would like to have this again in the future .
had this to wet my appetite ( and for my 400th review ) , on to the beer : **the** **beer** **is** **a** **clear** **copper** **in** **appearance** **with** **a** **head** that does n't last too long . as for flavor , it 's quite sweet . it reminded me of sam adams boston lager at the source , albeit with less hops . quite enjoyable .
**i** was **shocked** to find **such** **a** **wonderful** beer in a town where the **macros** seem to **advertise** **everywhere** ; i was surprised that i did not see a **neon** sign on the high school . but this is one killer beer and made me come back to the firehouse for 3 straight days . it **pours** **a** **deep** **dark** **brown** **with** **a** **slim** **head** **,** but it **produced** **such** **beautiful** **lacing** you just can not fault it . the aroma reminded me of a nice think hunk of dark bread dunked in a nice mellow bourbon . having this on the sampler woke me up as everything else while decent , had little character . but once i had it once i could see no reason to order anything else . the flavor was extremely malty with a subtle hoppiness , but the big alcohol punch it packed was what stood up to be noticed . unlike some high alcohol beers this was perfect in flavor and even though you could tell that it was strong , i felt that i needed to drink as many as i could . overall , a damn nice beer that i could really only compare to heavyweight 's purkuno 's hammer , but this might be a little more think and luscious , hard to believe as that is .
**i** **slammed** **this** beer before . i think that has alot to do with freshness , as i think this is a solid , **tasty** **everyday** **beer** that **does** **n't** always get what it deserves . fruity , cascade-packed , **then** **sort** **of** **thin** **and** **floating** **away** in the mouthfeel but **addicting** , this beer is a museum of the first wave of ipa 's . i think this one still stands up , especially when considered to other examples that just seem sort of boring these days ( however valid that sentiment is ) . try it if you have n't . and throw a six of the fresh stuff in the fridge if you have and show your uneducated beer friends that ipa 's can be simple and not palate assaulting .
**stately** **,** **mature** , characterful and slight eccentric- this is belgian brewing at its best ! with less tartness than flemish reds **or** **lambics** but with a rich depth of character that distinguishes it from the typical belgian **doubles** and **triples** . understated yet creamy carbonation allows for a mellow decanting- nearly cask-like . distinct aromas ar of must , peaty earth , lightly horsey and with a cork-like wodiness . rich malt flavors push to the forefront , but foregoing the associates sweetness of caramel or sugar . medium bodied in texture , the mild lemony sourness seems to further lighten the malt-forward ale and usher in a soft lactic dryness . mildly astringent when the woody notes pronounce , but the finish is a marvelous malty-dry yet crisply tart combination that work in harmony a light earthy/briney flavor reminds me orval except with more body and sweetness . riding on the side saddle with french ales but with the sour attitue of the senne valley the beer is a new adventure with each sip . masculine and refines but without pretention .
served **in** a pokal at the firkin . **what** a nice surprise finding this beer here this **night** . **it** **pours** **a** **cloudy** **,** **really** **pale** **straw** **topped** **by** **nearly** **two** **fingers** **of** **white** **froth** . the nose comprises smokey charcoal and what seems like a nice bit o ' sweet pineapple . did n't see that coming , i can tell you that . the taste holds notes of peppercorns , light smoke , chipotle peppers , cardamom , light lemon zest , wheat , and a stronger layer of char lining the background . the body is light , with a moderate carbonation and a dry finish . overall , an interesting take on the smoked helles , something i wish i could get more often 'round here .
**seems** to have been **bottles** mid-february **.** **pours** **a** **brown-amber** **capped** **with** **a** **1.5-finger** **ecru** **head** **that** **leaves** **a** **good** **bit** **of** **lacing** on my glass . the first thing that hits the nose is a grapefruit-y hop aroma . definitely getting buttered popcorn ( diacetyl ) and a little alcohol . i 'm not really liking this aroma , but i guess it 's not all bad . bright , puckering hops hit the palate up front with citrus and accompanying pith . i at first found the label , touting this as malty and robust , to be really misleading , but as this beer warmed some toasty maltiness comes through ; now it 's just misleading . the finish is a dry , whole-mouth bitterness that lasts well until the next sip . mouthfeel is medium-thin with prickly carbonation . this is n't bad beer , but i certainly wo n't be picking it up again , and would probably hold off on recommending it if there are other options .
22oz bottle pouted into **a** **goblet** **:** **opaque** **orange** **with** **a** **light** **,** **white** **,** **creamy** **head** that was not all that well retained but full of carbonation , but did settle into a **small** **thin** **cap** . the aroma was more belgian triple than ipa , sweet and malty the taste is a very nice balance of the two styles . a little more hops , but balanced very nice with the sweetness of the malt and fruit . the beer had a medium to full body , perhaps a little too thick for my taste , but still good . the beer had a nice bitter dry aftertaste and was well carbonated . the beer was fairly easy to drink give the abv , but after the 22oz , i was pretty well done . overall , a good beer and probably the first one of the side projects that i think the brewery should consider brewing on a regular basis .
12 oz bottle poured into pint glass **.** **appearance** **:** **hazy** **dark** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **thin** **off-white** **head** **.** smell : a great combination of bready , caramel malts and grassy , citrus hops . neither seems to overpower . taste : this is where the hops take over . a pungent hop punch hit you immediately surrounded perfectly by a fruity malt character . some apples and maybe honey ( ? ) are present . very complex taste . finishes very clean with only a slight pleasant bitterness . mouthfeel : full-bodied goodness . the dueling hops and malt feel good . drinkability : this could be a dangerous beer . it hides the abv well with a clean finish . the big malt backbone may make this more difficult to drink for some .
**the** first **careful** **pour** from a long-standing bottle **delivers** **a** **crystal-clear** **golden-orange** **and** **yellow** **body** that teems with **fine** **,** **effervescent** **bubbles** **beneath** **a** **two** **inch** **head** **of** **densely** **creamy** **white** **froth** **.** **the** **head** **retention** is excellent and it maintains **a** **solid** **quarter** **inch** **of** **cream** as well as **leaving** **almost** **completely** **solid** **walls** **of** **lace** throughout the glass . the nose delivers a sweetish , **candy** laced malt that 's brightened with a touch of orange , melon , and perhaps vanilla amidst a sprinkling of coriander . in the mouth its tiny bubbles foam-up on the tongue , giving a little tingle before it becomes pillowy soft and lightly creamy . the flavor expresses what the nose suggests , but with more ferver . it 's vanilla is much clearer than the nose suggests , and its delicately citrusy orange character balances the candy and vanilla alongside a sublime spiciness of coriander and white pepper . its bitterness is well heeled ; and it 's superbly balanced for the style - particularily given it 's 9 % alcohol which never fully shows ! an astounding beer that 's rich without being bold enough to hinder its drinkability , and complex enough to remain interesting throughout several glasses . additionally , this is well worth stocking up on as it should appeal to a wide variety of guests in your home , and works equally well during a cool summer evening on the back porch as it does during the holiday season
on tap at jacktoberfest in a **plastic** **cup** **appearance** **:** **amber** **with** **a** **tan** **one** **finger** **head** **that** **lingers** **;** **decent** **lacing** smell : malty , bready ; some spiciness taste : very smooth , malts come through with an almost sweet finish . light hops mouthfeel : medium , really coats the tongue overall : i was never too excited about this one from a bottle . but on tap , the freshness really comes through . smooth , yet robust . a nice fall beer . a really solid seller at the beer garden i was pouring at .
**auburn-tinted** **amber** **under** **a** **surprisingly** heathly rise of buttercreme fuseled nose of **vodka** , **cherry** **juice** , dark rum , bourbon , biscuits , and caramel into the mouth , it begins with a dripping caramel and **black** **liquorice** **hues** . and for a moment , this could well be mead , full of honey and sweet alcohol . it gathers thickness , as well as gummi sweet & sour cherry notes . it lingers here a while , sagging under its own girth , with the cherry and oak chip glinting sourness barely offsetting the maple syrup and brown sugar cloy . it rides out with a minced date , apicot , cherry , and blood orange fruitness , still dappled in caramel and cooked sugars . boil all this into a spiced rum bath heavy , obese , bodied . to say that this drinks like mrs butterworth is no hyperbole , nor is it libel . honestly , this is probably best served poured unto pancakes that said , it can be tackled in successive sips , and thus distances itself from avery 's other high proof ventures . diabetics and other sweet-aversive people beware .
**a=virtually** **no** **head** **,** **deep** **amber** **almost** **black** **s=smoky** **smell** , some fruity notes t=smoky taste , roasted malts evident , almost chocolate m=even with **no** head carbonation is tight though feel is heavy and thick d=not one of my favorites though i will drink again , probably would not choose as a session beer
-- -- 2003 vintage -- - i am a pretty big fan of samichlaus , although it definitely is n't my favorite . however , i recently tried a 7 year old bottle , and i realized how wonderfully it can age . the appearance **was** **a** **great** **,** **thick** **looking** **dark** **brown** . it almost seemed to pour like it was caramel . the taste fit in with the caramel description . it was thick , malty , and delicous . i am glad there are n't too many 7 year old 'sammies ' around , or this would be a dangerous beer . i was dreading the end of the glass
**on-tap** at the brewery . there’s no way this beer is 10 % by the way . **more** **like** **half** that a : served **a** **dark** **cranberry** **juice** **color** **with** **woody** **highlights** **and** **a** **very** **thin** **light** **pink** **collar** **.** **no** **lace** s : musty notes of raspberries and slight vinegar . there is definitely a basement must to the odor . t : sweet raspberry flavors with a bit of earthy must , dank basement , a touch of wood , and strong notes of fruit pits and red/dark fruit skins . the finish is cherry skin like , and the light tart/sourness is that of fruit skins . luckily i’m hardly getting any vinegar m : tingly lively carbonation , medium body with a slick and sticky mouthfeel . it’s dryish but barely , and there is just a hint of tartness to the mouth o : not the worst framboise i’ve ever had but it’s nothing super special . good for the brewery . i can’t knock lodi for its variety of styles .
22 ounce **bottle** **.** **pours** **hazy** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **nice** **2** **finger** **white** **head** **with** **very** **good** **retention** **that** **reduces** **to** **a** **lacing** **cap** **that** **leaves** **nice** **lacing** . aromas of caramel , citrus , grapefruit , floral , and pine . taste of strong grapefruit , with caramel , spice , and pine . finishes off with a nice clean bitterness and lingering citrus and fruit flavor . definitely one of the best balanced ipa 's i have come across . very smooth drinking . a little bit of alcohol warming on the finish . medium body and carbonation . this is phenomenal , will definitely buy again .
**surprisingly** **there** was some of this still around **2** **days** **after** the **2** brothers event at blind tiger , lucky me . **a-** **dark** **coppery** **brown** barely able to peak through . **very** **little** **head** , just a splotch of some micro bubbles bunched together in the middle **with** **a** **thin** **ring** around **the** glass **s-light** malty with a touch of sugary red wine . pretty sweet . t- starts off with the sweetness i anticipated , but never really peaks- luckily . there is a sustained maltiness with a touch of red wine-ness in there . i really enjoy the nutty notes in there , with the sweetness it gives me some brittle like flavors   m- light- med bodied with a little viscosity . no carbonation goin on here d- tasty beer , a little on the sweet side . i would not have guessed it was oak aged . i like the nuttiness . reminds me of a sweet nut brown ale .
**appearance** **:** **the** **pour** **produces** **a** **dark** **tan** **,** **.5** **'** **head** **that** **gradually** recedes back into the liquid from which it came , save for a ring around the glass and a small island **of** **froth** . the beer is practically **black** **in** color , save for some brown light escaping from the edges . smell : dominant roasted , hazelnut , woody aromas . definately a considerable aroma of bourbon barrel , with some light vanilla accompanying . somewhat sharp alcohol sting , but not as bad in my opinion as others have mentioned . maybe some age mellowed it out . moderately sweet , with a dark chocolate aroma . a milder ris aroma , but nice . low to moderate hop aroma . mouthfeel : the carbonation is on the light side of the medium range , and the body is just above medium . taste : semisweet chocolate , roasted barley , oak , and some nuttiness up front . just the slightest alcohol tinge . finish astringent with just a little hop aroma . drinkability : easy purchased from the caboose in va with dirtylou on the way back from our dogfish excursion last summer ... cellared since then .
thanks to wnoble for the chance to try this . 22 oz . bomber into a **duvel** **tulip** **.** **poured** **a** **opaque** **black** **with** **a** **generous** **three-finger** **mocha** **head** **which** **settled** **to** **a** **coating** **.** **lacing** was almost **non-existent** as it warmed . nose was pine and floral hops , some chocolate , and a little roasted grain . taste was awesome - well-blalanced but hop-forward . like most things i enjoy , there was an interesting interplay , in this case between the sweetness of the malt ( chocolate and toasted grain ) and the great hop prescence - tropical fruits , bitterness , etc . there were some spice notes as well . mouthfeel was medium with moderate carbonation . all-in-all , this was a very nice offering i would have again - if i only could ...
poured from a 375 ml bottle a : **poured** **a** **deep** **golden** **color** **,** most comparable to tree sap . **very** **little** **head** **,** **but** **permanent** **lacing** s : definitely sourness straightforward . when you smell it , it has that piercing sourness that hits you in the jowls , also kinda dusty if that makes sense t : a very citrusy type of sourness , almost like a lemon balm , also has deep earthy characteristics f : very tingly and smooth . very good carbonation , and again , hits you in the jowls on the finish overall , i really like this one . ca n't say i 've ever had a bad rr beer though . if you like wild ales and sours , this is the top one i would recommend . it was a very , , very complex beer though , so i will be revisiting it soon . cheers , russian river
**appearance** **:** **light** **amber** **color** **,** **thick** **head** **with** **nice** **lacing** . smell : strong malt aroma with slight alcohol followed . taste : mild malt sweetness , then nice hop bitterness , alcoholic at the finish . mouthfeel/drink : medium bodied , smooth to drink , but not impressed . the brewery say they use very old ice age melting water coming from scandinavia . i can not tell the difference between glacier water and normal water , just a selling point i think .
**a** **:** **the** **beer** **is** **cloudy** **brownish** **amber** **in** **color** **and** **poured** **with** **a** **thin** **off** **white** **head** **.** s : there are aromas of malty sweetness in the nose . t : there is a moderate amount of sweetness in the taste , which also has some hints of dark fruits and spices . m : it feels medium-bodied and smooth on the palate with a light amount of carbonation . d : the beer definitely tastes strong but the alcohol is well masked from the taste .
**this** **beer** **pours** **a** **coppery-amber** **with** **fair** **head** **and** **little** **retention** . it tastes moderately hoppy , slightly metallic , and mildy fruity . the brew is simply mediocre . always been on the fence with this one . its strangely filling for my stomach , maybe thats why its called fat angel
**this** **brew** **is** **a** **clear** **,** **almost** **cherry** **red** **colour** **with** **nothing** **for** **head** . **okay** **,** **a** **thin** **white** **head** formed on an aggressive pour , but it was gone before i could sit down . the smell is somewhat sweet , bready and floral . a fairly strong aroma , and not unpleasant . the taste is much like the smell up front , but its finish is a bit of a mystery to me . there is a fair burst of flavour over the back of the tongue . it makes me think of black licorice , but that is n't exactly it . i 'll have to read through some of the other reviews to see if anyone pinned it down . anyway , i find the flavour is about average , it is n't greatly pleasing to me , but not offensive either . mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side , and the beer is fizzy , not very comfortable to leave on the tongue for too long . not a bad beer really , but not something i 'll be looking for on shopping trips .
750 ml bottle served slightly chilled in a **delirium** **noel** glass **.** **appearance** **:** **clear** **brown** **with** **ruby** **overtones** **topped** **by** **a** **nice** **healthy** **beige** **head** **.** **streamers** of **bubbles** **keep** **the** **head** pretty decently replenished and assist **in** **leaving** **decent** **amounts** **of** **lace** on the sides of the glass . smell : strong spicy clove aromas dominate , with some light pepper , bubblegum , yeast , and banana scents kicking around . taste : clovey and peppery with some nice caramel malt and candi sugar sweetness to balance it all out . not overly complex . mouthfeel : great carbonation on a medium bodied beer . relatively crisp . drinkability : pretty decent , but there are definitely better beers out there in this style : maudite , trois pistoles , and la terrible to name a few .
presentation : it was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a pint glass . **appearance** **:** **the** **head** is has a **slightly** **off** **white** **color** and it **builds** up **thick** **and** **foamy** **.** it **slowly** **fades** down to a **wispy** **thin** layer that just hangs on until the end . there is very **little** lacing to speak of . the body has a **light** **golden** **amber** **color** **with** **very** **good** **clarity** . smell : its aroma is light and has a sweet grainy character with a very mild hop presence . taste/mouth feel : the flavor has a simple light grain and mild sweetness with a good balance of earthy and floaral hops . the texture is smooth and slightly slick with mild carbonation . its body is about medium . notes : overall i feel that it is a rather boring marzen .
**a-** **this** **one** **pours** **black** **with** **a** **finger** **of** **sticky** **slightly** **darker** **than** **beige** **colored** **head** **s-** lost of chocolate , licorice , booze and roasted malts . t- lots of chocolate . some licorice . roasted malts . some raisins and plums that i couldnt smell . great coffee finish m- thick and full bodied . hard to sense carbonation . warms as it goes down . d- an easy drinker . the alcohol is well hidden in the taste . trouble some to have more than one , but something im glad this area can finally get .
2009 version on cask at hop **project** **day** **a-slightly** **hazed** **,** **ruby-red** **grapefruit** **tinged** **copper** **with** **a** **cask** **driven** **billowing** **white** **head** **that** **reduced** a bit **and** **left** **caking** **lace** . s-fresh , **bright** floral , citrus and light spicy hop pop up front with a pleasant underlying light caramel malt sweetness . t-initial hop notes of fresh citrus , spicy pine and floral notes with the backing of sweet caramel malt . quite balanced but does lean towards the hops . m-medium bodied quite smooth with only a touch of sharpness . long lingering hop bitterness . d-i have always been an odyssey fan and this beer on cask simply shines . very well constructed .
( 500 ml bottle **)** **.** **typical** **hefe** **cloudy** **golden** **,** **large** **head** . lovely strong aroma of ripe bananas , bubblegum and cloves . cloves in the flavour too , light bodied , tasty but could still use some more 'bite ' . like most weissbiers not too much aftertaste . good , not outstanding . rerate : this is a beer i come back to all the time , as it is relatively cheap in norway ( available at vinmonopolet ) and very refreshing . not a great beer if you are looking for the big flavours , though .
thanks **goes** out to unclejedi for this brew . 2009 vintage poured into **a** **chalice** **a** **black** **color** **,** some carbonation , not much of a head at all , a couple of tiny islands appear . the nose is malty , with some oak notes , chocolate , toffee , some spice . the taste is malty , nice oak note , chocolate/toffe , with some spices . medium body . drinkable , this is a pretty tasty brew , but not what it 's hyped up to be .
12oz bottle , no dating . brewed by elevator in columbus **.** **pours** **a** **darker** **golden** **color** **with** **a** **fizzy** **white** **head** **and** **soapy** **lacing** which hangs around for the duration of the drink . smell is slightly off-putting ; the malt comes off a bit musty and plastic-like . that same plastic-like note is in the flavor as well . grassy , vegetal notes come through along with some sweetness from the malt , but the plasticity is tough to overcome . nice body , particularly for the style , so no complaints there . quite simply , the recipe needs to be tweaked . hopefully it 's just a bad batch , because all the other elements are there for a solid pale lager .
bottle courtesy of seeswo . 2010 vintage served in my old stock **snifter** **.** **pours** **a** **translucent** **mahogany** **with** **a** **loose** **,** **half-inch** **off-white** **head** **that** **quickly** **disperses** towards the shoulders , **forming** **a** **thin** **,** **bubbly** band . there 's also a residual oily slick across the center of the glass . nose expresses milk chocolate , a trace of dark fruit and a pleasant buttery vanilla character . only the merest suggestion of bourbon presents itself . taste expresses toffee , butter candied fruit and a slightly acrid ethanol character that lingers at the back . mouthfeel is medium-light ( but closer to light ) with a slightly coarse carbonation and quite a bit of residual heat that lingers on the tongue and at the back of the throat . all and all , a pretty good barleywine that could use some time to allow that alcohol presence to dissipate . that said , if the alcohol does in fact dissipate , the thinness to the body would be more prominent . i 'm not sure if a lot of age will improve this beer , but another year in the cellar might reveal a decent balance .
**pours** **a** **very** **hazy** **orange** **golden** **with** **a** **thin** **head** **that** **settles** **to** **a** **ring** . smells of lemon and some slightly sweet malt , with a touch of light , earthy bitterness . lacks some of the exuberant yeastiness of the style , but not bad . light yeast , very light spiciness with just the barest wisp of clove , slight tang on the finish . smooth and light rather than crisp in the mouth , not quite a zingy and flavorful and quenching as i like my hefes .
**this** **is** **a** very tasty doppelbock that 's also very mellow and easy to drink . **almost** **black** **,** it has **a** **very** **large** **light** **brown** **head** **very** **slowly** **shrinking** . the aroma is rich prune , raisins , sweet brown bread , bread cruast , hints of dark rum . the taste is rich , dark toasted brown bread , molasses cake , prunes , winey prunes and raisins , faintly rummy and with a hint of coffee . it 's generally sweet with with very faint bitterness and spiciness . the feel is rich and smooth and it 's very smooth and easy to drink .
12 oz bottle into a tulip glass . a : **pours** **a** **2** **1/2** **'** **head** **that** **falls** to **a** **respectable** **creamy** presence **.** **absolutely** **beautiful** **deep** **amber** **auburn** **color** **.** very nice to look at . s : potpourri , spicy candied apples . just okay . t : definitely get that candied spiced apple thing ( like those bright red things you see in a jar ) . cinnamon , clove , caramel malt . too novelty for me . m : thin , drying d : very interesting but not past 1/2 of the glass .
**nicely** **dark** **body** for this style , its **a** **deep** **brown** **with** **hints** **of** **amber** on **the** **sides** **.** **hosts** **a** **2** **finger** **head** **that** **is** **a** **rich** **tan** **that** **leaves** **nice** **lace** as it fades . super hoppy nose yields a late season ripe citrus feel with nice balance . rich and bitter mingle together as you indulge into this one at first sip . hops come off soft and long but well presented . bitterness is balanced with a slight malt character . a shockingly bold belly warmer for the style , woams more like an impy stout . mouthfeel is a hop induced malt mix richness . very well made lovely brew for the season . i wish i could find this beer and many others from these guys in indiana .
12 oz bottle **pours** **a** **clear** **,** **light** **copper** **color** **with** **a** **tall** **,** **light** **tan** **head** **.** **fades** **slow** **and** **leaves** **lots** **of** **sticky** **lace** . **very** **nice** looking beer . nose is a very nice blend of hop aromas . tropical and minty with a bit of alcohol backdrop . malts are pretty light , as the appearance would suggest , lending a biscuity aspect . this one is all about the hop flavors . bitterness builds from low to high and the lighter , grainier malt backbone lets the multitude of tropical hop flavors to come forth . abv is hidden well and the body is nice and creamy . i think this is the best beer saint arnold has ever made . i actually think it could at least hang with some of the better cali ipas/iipas .
**the** **bottle** **looks** **like** **a** small wine-bottle **,** brown 33 **cl** longnecked . the small label at the bottom **is** **yellow** and has got a picture of s : t erik ( or erik jedvardsson , a swedish king from the mid 12th century ) . a : **pours** **pale** **golden** **with** **an** **airy** **white** **,** **kind** **of** **fluffy** **head** **.** **slow** **dissipation** **leaves** **quite** **nice** **lacings** s : lots of american hops , piney and citric - there are both grapefruit as well as pineapple . but besides the nice-smelling hops i ca n't smell anything else t : the taste is better balanced than the smell - there 's everything from the smell , but in combination with a slight roasted maltyness m : aftertaste is short , but holds both some sweetness but also bitterness . body is kind of weak and carbonation is medium . d : not a bad beer , but there are lots of other 'summerbeers ' i rather drink . the good thing about this one is the bold hoppyness . but if you are n't into hops this one would do nothing for you .
**this** **pours** **a** **very** **cloudy** **lemon** **colour** **.** **some** **retention** **of** **head** . not a pretty beer . lots of banana on the nose . a little bit of spice as well . the banana continues on the palate . some sweetness is evident . medium bodied with a high level of carbonation . very refreshing on a hot day .
received a 4 pack ( nicely aged , i might add ) from a friend . poured into the snifter well **and** **has** **a** **nice** **golden** **appearance** **,** **with** **a** **nice** **light** **head** . a bit **hazy** , almost like a heffie type beer . general aroma was nice and fruity . i was excited to sit and watch the thunder storm roll in whilst enjoying this beer . drank it slightly chilled , but not cold , to savour the true flavours ... .which were nice and robust . the taste is very good , and not overpowering like some in its style class , but still enough flavour so you take notice . definately becoming a favourite of mine . will need to get my hands on more for sure . not a food beer , but better after dinner sitting with friends on the porch .
**i** was in new zealand for an entire month , and on arrival **i** **was** **quite** looking forward to **the** **beers** of a former british holding . i was **sorely** **disappointed** **almost** the entire time i was there -- **most** beers tended to be sweet **,** **thick** **,** **and** malty like american malt liquor without the high abv that justifies them . until i met **sassy** red ... a : actually **,** **sassy** **red** **is** **n't** **all** **that** **red** **,** **sort** **of** **amber** with **a** suntan . s : the smell is the best part -- it 's biscuity and toasty with some nut oil -- brazil nut and almond - in there , all carried out with popping hoppiness right on the front of the nose . t : unlike most amber/reds with toasty notes in the nose , sassy red actually carried those comforting flavors in to the taste . the only reason that this rating does n't exceed a four is because the beer is marketed as a bitter , but in fact its not as bitter as it might be . it is more hoppy than bitter -- more vegetal than a bitter might normally express . m : thinner than it could be , and carries just a little too much carbonation for its type of flavor , but still very pleasant and slick . d : it must be drinkable -- i had about 8 in the auckland airport while my flight was delayed . this is a beer i want as my first and my last of the night -- something i can say about few others . it is flavorful enough to get me going and keep me interested , but not in any way cloying or too heavy . i already miss sassy red and i just got back .
**hard** to find - mostly a northern midwest beer **hence** the name . **pour** was **avg** **.** **typical** **lager** . this beer has a little more flavor and bite than most **lagers** . somewhat **creamy** and malty it went down easy - a bit pricey but a good change of pace from typical american lagers yes - some of us enjoy good ol ' american brew .
**cloudy** **yellow** **in** **color** **w/** **a** **thick** **head** that is n't quite as well retained compared to other hefeweizens . tart wheat notes w/ mild banana & bubblegum yeast esters in aroma . the aroma is n't as complex as other examples of the style , and is akin to a more tart , but less estery paulaner aroma . flavorwise , yeast contributions are subdued for style , but musty and light banana flavors are present . grainy , tart wheat flavors assert themselves since they 're not overpowered by yeast esters . the finish consists of residual sweetness and a hint of a grainy note . like other pinkus brews , it 's stylistically odd , but flavorful enough to warrant a taste .
**poured** on-tap at the cigar city brewing tasting room in tampa . served in a pint glass , **the** **beer** **pours** **a** **dark** **brown** **coloring** **with** **a** **thin** **layer** **of** **off-white** **head** **.** smells are slightly hoppy and citrusy . the beer 's flavors are wet hops and grapefruit initially , with a tangy , sweet caramel and chocolate blend at the end . flavors are similar to a red ipa . slightly boozey and slick consistency , with an astringent and drying finish .
**a-** **pours** **a** **cloudy** **and** **hazy** **orange-amber** **hue** **with** **a** **nice** **amount** **off** **craggy** **white** **head** **that** is **sustaining** **and** **leaves** **a** **fair** **amount** **of** **lacing** on the glass s- aroma is mostly citrus and floral hops along with yeasty wheat malts t- hmmmm , initial taste is of wheat and sweet malts , followed by bread malts and dark citrus in the middle , and finishing with an unassuming touch of dry hops and alcohol m- medium-bodied hefe with an almost oily texture , light carbonation d- at 7.5 % abv , this is definitely on the strong-side for a hefe , fairly drinkable overall , but lacks any unique characteristics for a repeat buy . i think the biggest knock on this beer is that it tries to be both an ipa and a hefe but fails at both , sometimes 'hybrids ' are not the best picks for beers and this shines with this 'imperial hefeweizen ' . if i want a good ipa , there are plenty of better choices , and the same holds for hefes , i see no situation in which i would want the hoppiness of an ipa with the wheat/syrupy maltness of a hefe . but props to pyramid for trying something new
**i** had this out of a 12 oz brown bottle and served in a british imperial pint glass . enjoy by date clearly marked for april 26 2005 . this beer is a freshy . the aroma on this beer is phenomenal . strong whiffs of citrus fruit ( grapefruits , oranges , and limes ) and balsam fur **pine** **.** **clearish** **yellow** **,** **light** **orange** **color** **.** **nice** **sticky** **lacings** **cling** and stay all over the glass medium bodied with a really smooth mouthful . again , pine and citrus are blending together to create a sweet and bitter combo . sweet and crisp with a major hop bite . incredibly drinkable at 8.5 % abv . this beer is a treat and one of the best double ipa 's i 've had i 'm so glad this beer just began working its way into boston . this is one masterpiece of an ipa .
a testament to aging **quality** **ales** , only to be served in **a** **red** **wine** glass **or** **tulip** **.** **a** **:** **hazy** **shade** **of** **bronze** **,** **a** **smallish** **off-white** **head** with **tears** of hops and malts abounding . s : wonderful balance as the hops have mellowed out enough to let the malts shine through the forest for all the trees . aromas of pine , caramel , grapefruit , pineapple and charred walnuts . t : as it warms up , the flavors suggested by the scents begin to emerge . another year may merge the two perfectly . m : medium to full-bodied , a old guardian aged some 1.5 years is viscous and luscious d : some claim to be able to drink more than one of these 22oz bombers . ok , but if you 're willing to split the second one among three or four , i 'd be happy to savor this night cap a case of this is well worth procuring . a few during the infant years , a few right about now and the rest over time . to my mind , a beer cellar needs old guardian keeping the treasure safe .
**this** one was sent graciously to me by liamt07 , an **awesome** **trader** **.** **cheers** **buddy** **yellow** **color** **beer** with **some** **orange** notes **.** **head** **is** **white** **and** **disappear** **quickly** **.** **hazed** **and** **very** **opaque** . aroma is fruity ( cloves and bananas ) . typical of a hefeweizen taste shows notes of orange and the typical hefeweizen taste ( cloves and bananas ) . smooth and very effervescent . almost no bitterness too . very drinkable and refreshing . a nice hefeweizen .
**the** **appearance** **was** **nice** **.** **dark** **gold** with **not** **much** **of** **a** **head** **but** **nice** **lacing** when it started to dissipate . the smell was ever so hoppy with a hint of the grapefruit flavor that 's contained within . the taste was interesting , up front tart grapefruit , not sweet in the least . more like grapefruit rind even . slight hint of hops and seemingly no malt . the mouth feel was crisp , with some biting carbonation . drinkability was easily above average due to the crispness and lack of sweetness . not the usual taste you expect when drinking a fruit beer . in fact this is my favorite fruit beer ever .
**a** **:** **light** **golden** **,** not at all **'amber** **'** **.** **one** **finger** **head** **that** **is** **very** **white** , **no** a/c , **but** **pretty** **decent** **lacing** s : wet malt and a little hops . pretty bmc , like mickey 's or **pbr** , and pretty weak . t : it was bitter , but i have no idea where that came from . it was n't a hoppy taste and it was n't a roast obviously . not much else though . m : thin and metallic . d : pretty easy i guess .
**the** **beige** **head** **is** **comprised** **of** **medium-sized** **bubbles** **and** **slowly** , but inevitably , recedes to a thin strip ; there **is** **some** **lacing** adhering to the glass . black malt ( i think ) lends the beer a not pleasantly bitter and toasted flavour . i could n't detect chocolate . beck 's dark is a bit watery on the palate and has a bitter finish i ca n't complain too much about beck 's dark but i ca n't rave too much about it , either .
**a** **:** **this** **beer** **pours** **beautifully** **black** **with** **a** **really** **large** **brown** **thick** **head** that sure takes it 's time to **dissipate** **,** **leaving** **rich** **lacings** . s : heavy roasted malt , with some sweetness . some bitter hops along with dark chocolate and coffee . t : sweet heavy roasted malt , floral hops and dark chocolate . coffee along with dark dried fruit . m : the lingering aftertaste is sweet and bitter at the same time . medium body and light carbonation . d : nice and well balanced . heavy and light at the same time . great with a sweet cake .
**poured** **a** **lovely** **golden** **color** **with** **massive** **chunky** **white** **head** **.** **head** **lasted** **throughout** **and** **nice** **lacing** on the side of the glass . smell is truly enjoyable with nice notes of summer fruits , bananas , bubble-gum , and yeast . taste is also very pleasant with strong banana and other light fruit flavors . nice and creamy in the mouth with an almost syrup like feeling being left behind . some alcohol detected , but not what you would think for a 10.5 % beer . way too easy to drink . very enjoyable beer .
draft-only **brew** **master** **reserve** **beer** on tap in my basement **.** **poured** **a** **hazy** **yellow** **with** **a** **nice** **white** **head** **.** **nice** **lacing** . has a sweet , grassy malty nose to it from the german pilsner malt , but has a surprising nice spicy hop kick to it at the end along with a little sourness . hops used were german hallertauer perle , czech saaz , american glacier which is a relatively new hop in the fuggle family from the pacific northwest . light to medium bodied . very easy drinking for a 6.5 % beer .
**a** **:** **poured** **a** **nice** **dark** **brown** **with** **a** **tan** **colored** **head** **about** **half** **an** **inch** **thick** **,** nice red/garnet accents when held to the light **.** **little** **clumps** **of** **lacing** all around the glass , not too shabby . not terribly impressive though s : smells like a more guinness-y guinness really , there are some roasted malts there , signature guinness smells , less burnt though , a little bit of chocolate , and i ca n't help but notice a distinct smell of chlorine/pool water ? glass was clean too ... hmmmm . slightly sour guinness smell as well t : pretty nice on the chocolate , not too much initially for the roasted/burnt flavor , still it is there , a nice black coffee flavor , not strong coffee , but just coffee . definitely a hop presence in this one that is n't in the draught guinness . clean and earthy , piney . not too bad . slight earthy aftertaste m : relatively thick , it is n't an export stout or imperial stout , but still is pretty hefty in the mouth , very smooth , not much carbonation . not too shabby d : not quite as drinkable as the draught , but still not too bad . i could easily see drinking a few of these .
**i** got the sampler tray at the snipes brewpub/restaurant in sunnyside , wa . sample size was approximately 4 **ounces** **.** **a-** **golden** **clear** **color** **and** **generous** **head** **in** spite of the little sampler glass size . s- strong florals and citrus from being dry-hopped , i presume . any aroma from the malts was hidden . t- i would liken this brew to a dry hopped version of their pale ale . flavor palate was dominated by the hops , which came through as floral and citrus . malts were over-dominated . m- thin , medium to light body . bitterness lingers as would be expected . alcohol is hidden . d- decent ipa-like beer . the dry hopping adds a nice floral aroma and flavor . interesting brew and worthy of a try .
**taste** **gets** **better** as it warms . i 'm not the kind who can pick out every individual yeast ester and give you a real world counterpart . i can tell you that this beer reminds me of a **very** **good** esb . this very much **tastes** like fuller 's esb . not one of those hopped up **ambers** . the biscuity malt . the fruit flavors . all of that . some differences , i assume . but i would need to have a fuller 's and this side by side to point them out to **you** **.** **beautiful** **amber** **color** **with** **nice** **head** **.** **head** **goes** down . **but** **a** **nice** **lacing** stays for a while . taste lingers . makes you crave more .
my expectations for an abbey ale from new belgium were not high . but since brewers and breweries evolve , i thought i should give **this** **a** **try** **pours** **clear** **orange/copper** **with** **a** **modest** **tan** **head** **that** **dissipates** to a **fine** **ring** of bubbles around the glass , **with** **some** **lacing** . aromas of wet hay , some fruit ( orange ) , and some hops way in the background . taste follows the nose with sweet malt , orange , lemon , a hint of milk chocolate , then a dry hoppy and somewhat spicy finish . overall , this is tasting to me like a dubbel light body is light , with good carbonation , it has a moderately creamy mouthfeel this is a drinkable dubbel style beer , but is lighter in substance than most abbey dubbels . at only 7 % abv , it is more drinkable and also more affordable than most belgian abbey doubles . might serve as a good introduction to the style for those who are experimenting in that direction .
**i** **hate** to be the guy **who** disses a top **rated** **brew** , but i guess today i am that guy . maybe i 'm just **sick** **of** **beers** like this , but i feel like once you 've had one double-imperial-chocolate-coffee-espresso-mocha-java-extravaganza stout you 've had 'em all . the coffee and chocolate flavors are too much for beer , or too at least too much for this beer . i love a nice stout that has a more subtle coffee or chocolaty flavor that 's imparted by the kind of malt they used , but this straight up infused flavor is too syrupy for me in general . do n't get me wrong , it is delicious , it 's just not something i like in my beer i 've decided appears **a** **dark** **pitch** **brown** **color** **,** **a** **wimpy** **head** **that** **dissapears** **quickly** . smells extremely roasty and sweet , but with a ton of nice bitterness in the form of coffee and bitter chocolate . maybe even from the hops but i ca n't really detect any . taste could be full of complex flavors , and the potential is there , but the palate is really overrun with the intense coffee bean chocolate party that 's going on in this beer . i 've already talked about that part ... the real saving grace of this beer is the mouthfeel . soft and pillowy , it 's so smooth and just velvety on the palate with a slight chewyness . if i had no tastebuds even i would drink this just for the texture . to finish up , it could just be me or a stylistic sort of preference thing , but the strong coffee flavors do n't work for this beer i hate to say . check out the black rye from founders , there 's a killer beer for ya .
**a** **:** **the** **beer** **is** **clear** **yellowish** **orange** **in** **color** **and** has a light amount of visible carbonation . it poured with **a** **thin** **off** **white** **head** . s : there are moderate aromas of fruity yeast and floral hops in the nose . t : the taste has some maltiness with notes of fruit . there is some sourness in the finish . m : it feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation . there are some hints of dryness in the finish . o : the beer is somewhat unique for the style because it is quite fruity and malty .
tried this at a thai place that was out of **tsingtao** . **not** a **bad** beer . i think i preferred this greatly over **asahi** **.** **pours** **a** **hugely** **carbonated** **pale** **yellow** **that** **is** **transparent** . nothing really exciting about it . not a lot of nose , a little citrus but mostly a clean aroma ( probably because of the rice ) tasted good and clean , a little sweet and a little citrus . very refreshing , especially when drank with a sticky hot thai dish ( i had this with my shrimp coconut soup and red curried duck ) lots of fizz in the mouth from the extreme carbonation . i kind of liked it very drinkable , i could have had several but since we were just out for dinner i had to settle for two .
on tap at **rr** in santa **rosa** . **poured** **in** **a** **short** **glass** **to** **a** **cloudy** **brownish-ornage** **with** **medium** **thick** **off-white** **head** **that** **lingers** **well** **and** **leaves** **okay** **lacing** . nose is sour red fruit and hops , mouthfeel thick and tangy-sweet and the taste a perrfect follow to the scents in the nose , with some alcohol added in at mid-glass . like a good flemish sour , the finish was long and a rush of tangy fruit , quickly followed by a warming sugar sweetness . not quite the duchesse , but a damn good sour .
**a-** **pours** **a** **mid-golden** **with** **a** **short** **lived** **small** **fizzy** **white** **head** . got a few streams of carbonation **floating** **upward** **.** **no** **lacing** **,** **below** **average** **head** **retention** **.** **s-** smells of sweet malt . t- follows the nose . had to ponder what it tastes like because it was distinct although unknown to me ... have to agree with the two reviewers below me , green apple and cheerios . what an odd combo ... but somehow it works , kinda . m- full , syrupy-feeling for the style . d/o- nothing to write home about but could be a lot worse . per the style i 'd have to say it 's middle of the pack .
**poured** from the 12-ounce bottle into a pint glass at room temperature this brew **shows** **a** **hazy** **carmel** **color** **with** **an** **out** **of** **control** **oatmeal** **colored** **head** **and** **layers** **of** **lacing** . the aroma is a really nice sweet malt and herbal hops . very thick smell with an edible quality that also notes thick brown bread and apple . the taste is a nice medium bodied tartness with some dry hops blended with caramel malt . pretty chewy stuff for an ipa , almost a mild dipa with some alcohol noted . midland drinkable , definitely worth a try but just short of spectacular .
**poured** from a 14.9 oz nitro can in to an imperial pint glass . **pours** **a** **very** **clear** **,** **light** **tea** **color** **with** **a** **a** **beautiful** **big** **nitro** **head** . very little smell . light hop smell with even less malt . creamy taste ( aided by **thick** head ) with buttery , biscuity taste that is stronger than the original smell . slight bitterness in the aftertaste . mouthfeel is great due to the **nitro** head . very drinkable session beer that has minimal flavor for a somewhat quality beer . nice to have around .
**a** **very** **dark** **brown** **beer** **with** **a** **small** **head** , that **forms** **a** **small** **off-white** **layer** on the side of the glass . smell is coffee , strong sweet chocolate and above all black malt , like the grains smell . some vanilla to smooth the roast taste is mildly roasted with a heavy chocolate taste , which makes a sweet impression . i get hints of cacoa , vanilla , en **cappucino** . the beer 's body is just right for this kind of beer . some sweetnes , but not too sticky . bitterness is low and the beer is nicely balanced .
**clear** **(** ! ) bottle . **pours** **dark** **reddish-** **brown** **with** **a** **short** **lived** **,** **off-white** **head** . nose is grassy hops , hints of toffee and cherry . medium , slightly crisp body . caramel malt , toffee balanced on the palate by grassy hops , some hints of raisins and mineral water . medium , semisweet finish . pleasant , drinkable brew .
**this** **beer** **poured** **a** **hypnotically** **deep** **amber** **color** **almost** as though it wanted to be an american **brown** **.** **near** **white** **head** **that** **faded** **quickly** way darker than i was expecting . hops nose but not nearly as aggressive as most ipas . so far not what i think of an ipa . the taste is malty at the very beginning then followed by a punch of hops that hits you right in the back of the jaw . exactly what it should be . the finish is especially bitter and hoppy . the mouthfeel is good ; moderate carbonation and smooth . poignant and bitter in a notable way . a strange ipa but an outstanding one .
**a** : held up to the florida sun , **there** **is** **n't** **a** **shimmer** of **light** **shinning** **threw** **this** **chocolate** **stout** . on top of the **black** **liquid** **goodness** **sits** **a** **milk** **chocolate** **head** that happens to be the same color as the label on the bottle . s : just as i expected , choklat is the most chocolate smelling beer in the beer world . southern tier always impresses me with these kind of brews , but the lack of complexity is it 's only downfall . t : this brew reminds me of when i was a kid and used to put chocolate syrup on top of chocolate fudge that was on top of chocolate ice cream that was being eaten out of a chocolate cone ( with chocolate sprinkles of course ) . the fact that they managed to brew this stout at 11 % without affecting the flavor is amazing . mf : mouthfeel is like creamy milk chocolate ... .just they way it should be . d : drinkability is excellent . southern tier has some issues in this category for me because some of their brews are just too over the top ( see creme brulee ) , but who does n't love chocolate ( especially with a well hidden abv )
**this** **beer** **poured** **a** **very** **appealling** **copper** **reddish** **color** **.** it was very **clear** with **an** **average** **head** . i could immediately smell a sweet aroma , but did not immediately pick up on the currant . the first taste was just some sweetness , but then after a bit ( and after eating some mild cheese ) , the total fruitiness of the currant started to appear . it was a bit slow to develop , but then all of a sudden i could really taste it . the aroma also developed and the fruit was definitely present . i am not sure how much was the cheese acting as a palate neutralizer or simply that as it warmed the fruit came through . the beer just got better as i continued to enjoy it . of course , when tasting , eating food is not always advised , however , i will definitely say mild cheeses had no ill effect , but do not serve this beer to anyone while they are eating anything spicy or they will really miss out on its beauty .
**pours** **a** **very** **dark** **brown** **but** shows a lot of **red** **color** when held to the light , a surprising amount of which makes shows through **.** **head** **is** **tan** **,** **creamy** , a little over an inch , and both **lasts** **and** laces the glass well aroma is a tad lighter than the best examples , but sticking ones nose in reveals ample toasted malt covered with a chocolate , an herbal hop , no alcohol or diacetyl . flavor is quite good , full , sweet , balanced by a substantial bitterness - both from hops and a little from charred malt - which builds on the palate . a mild astringency is keeping it from an elite score . the char shows up much more in the flavor than aroma . body is barely medium but creamy , carbonation soft - more would be too much with the bitterness/astringency of the hop/malt bill . all in all it is a solid porter that i 'd have again . seems to be somewhere between the brown and robust styles
**this** **beer** **tastes** **very** **smooth** **and** is quite easy to drink . **reminds** me of redhood esb , but so much stronger ! i 'm glad i got this as a single in a mixed mystery bag , or i 'd be in trouble **.** **appearance** **-** **cloudy** **orange** **,** not much **of** **a** **head** **.** **no** **head** **after** **settling** . smell - bready taste - yeasty , caramel , a little sweet , strong tang ( from alchoholic content , i imagine ) mouthfeel - heavy , smooth -- not much carbonation drinkability - very drinkable . scarily so
**poured** froma 12 oz bottle into a sam adams glass ( hey , it was in reach ) . poured **clean** with **a** **nice** **deep** **golden** **straw** **color** **with** **over** **2** **fingers** **of** **crisp** **head** **that** **quickly** **sunk** **down** **.** **impressive** **lacing** on the glass , with legs aroma was full of grassy hops and caramel , with some alcohol presence on the nose . taste was extremely grassy with very little malt character at all , and extremely boozy . seems like they let this one ferment a bit too long . if they used a bit more malts and stopped fermentation to yield the same 8.5 % , this would be a far better beer . this beer is way too boozy for 8.5 % . dogfish head 's 120 minute tastes and smells less boozy , and that weighs in at 20 % mouthfeel is thin , dry , and bubbly . as a result , drinkability was not good . i had to switch off with water every so often , and looked for something to munch on to break the boozy grassy flavor from layering too thickly on my tongue . overall , this beer looks fantastic but just does n't live up to the quality expected in a iipa ; other breweries have set the bar fairly high with strong but balanced iipas . this one is just way too boozy and grassy to be enjoyable .
on tap at st . james infirmary this **is** **a** **killer** **amber** **ale** . it 's very strong and it 's very hoppy , but lagunitas is king at hoppy beers . there is always a solid balance for the huge amount of hops . so people who do n't consider themselves a fan of hops can still enjoy this beer , most likely . it 's weird that they call this a 'red ale , ' when it is clearly **an** **amber** **color** **.** **other** **amber** **ales** are far more red than this . check out the .alt version of this one too
22 oz bottle **poured** **a** **light** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **thin** **white** **layer** **of** **head** . aroma has pine hops , resin , caramel malt , and light citrus underlying . mouth feel is medium with light carbonation and coats the mouth well for a single ipa . flavor is heavily resinous with pines and bitterness . malt is high enough to keep it from being one sided and mixes in with light sweetness . finish is bitter and lingering on the tongue . definitely on the resinous bitter end of the ipa
**look** **:** **inviting** **,** **deep** darkness.not **entirely** **black** but close . **opaque** and not allowing much light in nose : nice aroma . carmelized malts and hops taste : carmel malts and light coffee notes without going bitter mouthfeel : pleasing mouthfeel that is creamy without feeling too heavy or grainy drink : enyirely drinkable ; on the order of a kostringer black lager but with southern hemisphere influences instead of the eastern european traditional notes .
**i** feel a little bad being the one to add this beer , since it 's far from my favorite style and **i** **did** **n't** like it very **much** **.** **pours** **a** **slightly** **hazy** **golden** **color** **without** **much** **head** . aroma is almost completely herbal - anise , lavender , clove , a touch of honey . palate is a little more balanced by pale ( pilsner ? ) malt , but still is huge on the herbal notes . finish is a little chalky and has a distinct bitter herb that i can isolate but am unable to actually identify . this is a light , easy drinking ale , but it 's kind of an experiment . not my bag , but i appreciate the effort to make an obscure style .
550ml bottle split with my brew buddy jared . a : **not** **jet** **black** **but** **a** **couple** **of** **shades** **lighter** **.** **dark** **tan** **head** **,** **excellent** **retention** **and** **beautiful** **lacing** . s : mildly sweet with a fair amount of chocolate and a hint of coffee . quite a bit of roast is present as well , along with a light earthy hop character . sweet oatmeal is present in the back . t : very well balanced , this beer opens with the roasted malt and the mild cocoa and coffee and oatmeal sweetness in perfect harmony . this beer is medium bodied , big enough to hold the flavors together while light enough to be truly refreshing . mildly bitter on the finish with flavors of oatmeal , chocolate and raisins lingering , this is smooth on the palate with light carbonation . a touch metallic on the finish ( iron ? ) , this is the only flaw i can point to here . the oatmeal does take the edge off the roasted malt bitterness . i could drink an awful lot of this .
**hazy** **orangey** **amber** **colored** **with** **almost** **no** **head** . the aroma contains a good amount of fruity clove aromas along with some yeast , grainy and floral qualities . a little brown sugary . the taste is fairly sweet and fruity witha little doughy yeast thrown in for good measure . some bubblegum shows up as it warms . a little spicy at the finish and aftertaste . the mouthfeel is medium with a pleasant coating quality . drinkability is not too bad , reasonably complex with no off flavors to take away . one of saranac 's better offerings .
**poured** **a** **deep** **tangerine** **colored** **beer** **with** **moderate** **slightly** **off-white** **puffy** **head** **.** smell has some nice notes of citrusy hops . taste also has the hops in the forefront , with not enough malt to back it up . leaves a nice dry sensation in the mouth . a good beer , but not quite great .
**dark** **black** with nearly no light at all shining through on this **one** **.** **rich** **tan** **colored** **head** **of** about two **inches** **quickly** **settled** down to about **a** **half** **inch** **of** **tan** that thoroughly coated the inside of the glass . this was what the style is all about the aroma was just loaded down with coffee . rich notes of mocha mixes in with a rich , and sweet coffee note . a tiny bit of bitterness and an earthy flare lying down underneath of it , but the majority of this one was hands down , rich brewed coffee . the flavor was more of the same . rich notes just rolled over the tongue in waves and thoroughly coated the inside of the mouth . sweet with touches of chocolate and vanilla to highlight the coffee notes ,
**pours** **an** **almost** **inky** **color** **.** it has a **small** head that is light **brown** **in** **color** **.** **it** **dissapates** quickly . a bit of caramel and coffee to the nose . very full body to the beer , almost 'thick ' . somewhat roasty , not as much as some others . a hint of sweetness , chocolate and a good hop bite . the alchohol is not evident at all . this is excellent
i 'm back on the air for the first time since katrina here , and thought it would be appropriate to start up again with a hometown brew ( though these days i 'm based in houston , sigh ) . i stopped by the abita brewpub on a visit to nola this weekend , and had a couple of pints of the pecan ale . i picked up a growler and babied it back to houston ( put it on **ice** in a cooler ) , and it seems to have made it back unscathed **.** **color** **is** **a** **nice** **deep** **copper** **,** **and** **the** **tan** **head** is ample even when it 's served a little on the cold side , as is the pint in front of me . even cold , though , the malty nose is prominent and enjoyable . carbonation is very active on the tongue , and while i generally prefer my brown ales a little more sedate in this respect , you could argue that this keeps it from being syrupy . taste is all smooth malt , edging onto sweet . very rich . the pecan presence is most noticeable in the finish , with a crisp , dry flavor precisely like fresh pecans . very southern , very lovely -- brews like this make me believe ever more deeply in drinking local . call it 'beer terroir ' . this is one of abita 's select series , meaning it 's only available on tap -- and only at their brewpub , in my experience , and only when they feel like brewing up a batch . this is one of the better abitas i 've had , and it would make the trek to the north shore more than worthwhile . bring ya growler
serving type : a 12 oz bottle poured into a **westmalle** **trappist** **chalice** **a** : **apple** **juice** s : sweet purfumey , bread , hops , a wonderful aroma t : complete opposite of the aroma . tart yet smooth , earthy , pine , a complex beer . m : smooth , with a tiny bite d : i would and will order/buy one of these again . a nice brew from stone ... .ca n't wait to try the imperial russian stout i just got ... .mmm

22oz bottle , im pretty sure it said 5.5 % abv , not 8 % this was gifted to me by a friend who assumed all 'lips of faith ' releases are **created** **equally** **appearance** **:** really a fantastic bottle design - very sharp ... served in new glarus flute **,** **pale** **strawberry** **body** **,** **very** **light** **white** **foam** **-** **no** **lace** smell : tart cranberry , cherry , vinegar , apple peel taste : not a huge fan of the kriek sub-genre ... this one provides the vinegar you 'd expect , sourness is downnplayed - tart cherry and cranberry , light oak . nothing really that wrong with this one - just not something i would turn to again mouthfeel : sourness in an unpleasant way , vinegary drinkability : ok
**this** **beer** **poured** **out** **as** **a** **nice** **golden** **color** **with** **a** **white** **head** **on** **top** **.** **the** **head** **retention** was pretty good on this brew . i found the smell of the beer to have a nice aroma of caramel and some light hops on the nose . the taste of the beer was really nicely done i thought . the flavors of sweet malts and the bitter finish worked well together . the mouthfeel was very drinkable and could easlier have serval back to back . overall this brew is pretty good and i would n't nmind drinking it again one day .
**poured** from a bottle into a duvel **tulip** **a-** **pours** **a** **dark** **shade** **of** **amber** **with** **a** **three** **finger** **slightly** **offwhite** **head** **.** **the** **head** **is** **very** **puffy** **,** **and** **the** lacing is all the way around the glass 4.5 s- earthy hops , but they smell absolutely wonderful and strong . getting some hints of cat piss as well ... simcoe up in here ? 4 t- wow , the bitterness is strong in this one . lots of pine up front , and the finish is slightly sweet . very solid 4 m- it has a real nice body to it , nice and thick . not chewy like a stout , but it has that nice ipa backbone to it o- really like this beer . tastes a lot like torpedo , but a little less abrasive and fresher . plus , at 4.79 for a bomber , it was a steal 5
**a** **-** **clear** **amber** **body** **with** **a** **large** **foamy** **offwhite** **head** **.** s - a big bouquet of raspberries and blueberries . fresh , sweet , tangy fruit aromas . floral hop notes . t - tangy fruit with a buttery back note . sweet splash of soft fruit liquor and tangy hops . fruit-like acidity , akin to apple skin . blueberry and dark fruit present here . tangy starches and spiced alcohol bring depth to this beers flavors . m - warming , drying medium body . clean on the palate and the carbonation buzzes the tongue . o - plenty of fruit in the nose and mouth . the starchy , buttery flavors add a different dimension here .
**a** **clear** **light** **amber** **to** **dark** **gold** **colored** **ale** **.** **good** **tall** **white** **head** **forms** and then falls some but does n't disappear . the smell is sweet with a little musty and earth scent like mushrooms . little bit of butter mixes in with the malt aroma , which is mostly biscuit . little bit of wood and leather is also present in the scent . slight tea , tobacco and wood aroma from the english hops used . the taste begins sweet and malty with a stouter than anticipated bitterness . this has a strong pipe tobacco flavor to it that is different and rather nice . this is a nice ale but it could be a little stronger it just seems to mellow out a little too much after a while . the mouthfeel is good . a pricey yet good ale without too much of the butter flavor that you come to expect from a wychwood beer and ringwood yeast strains . worth a try for sure but i ca n't really see reaching for this beer again because of the cost . for less money i will be reaching for the lagunitas and firestone beers for normal consumption .
**sort** **of** **an** **deeper** **honey** **color** **with** **a** **white** **fluffy** **head** . aromas of grapefruit tempered by earthy malt . the flavor is much the same , with the addition of a super sweet malt+alcohol taste that also provides a rich and somewhat sticky body . i went in kinda fast , but wound up sipping and savoring modestly at the end . very strong brew that masks itself well , though this is in the neutral zone of american dipa and barley wine .
served **from** **a** plain-looking **,** **yellow** labled 750 , this **tripel** **pours** **out** **bright** **,** **lightly** **clouded** **apricot** **yellow** **with** **a** **fantastisly** **dense** **and** **chunky** **white** **head** **that** **has** **epic** **retention** **and** **tons** **of** stick aroma is so much bigger than i expected from a tripel that ( only ) registers at 6.8 % . big , tropical and orchard fruit with funky , yeasty spice and a pepper/coriander bite . green apple and pear is shadowed by honeyish , pilsneresque malts , and complex , phenolic undertones featuring banana and buttery croissant . flavor registers equally high in my book . so surprising becuase it is relatively low abv % compared to the highest rated tripels . a complex malt and fruit entry is kicked up by creamy-sweet lemon curd , grated key lime peel , freshly baked pie crust , grahm cracker , and fluffy cotton candy . the finish is well-hopped with soft nuances of white pepper infused green herbs and saazy earthyness . complex and dry , excellent .
**a** : a 12 oz bottle poured into a pint **glass** **yields** **a** **brown** **ale** **with** **ruby** **hues** **and** **a** **1/2** **inch** **fluffy** **khaki/tan** **head** **.** **chunks** **of** **lacing** **cling** to the side of the glass as i drink my way down -- certainly **looks** nice s : sweet malty scents dominate -- caramel malt , hazelnut , some chocolate and brown sugar . not particularly strong , but not weak or watered-down in the nose either . t : like the nose -- malty flavors : caramel , burnt sugar and hazelnut but with a slightly bitter aftertaste providing decent balance . m : light-bodied ; plenty of carbonation . could use a little more heft . d : very good -- a light body and solid flavors make this one go down easy . notes : i had this on tap recently after doing some christmas shopping -- a big 23 oz draft -- and it was excellent . may have been a little bit better than the bottle , or it could have been that i really needed a break from shopping at that point .
finally got my hands on this **one** **.** **a** **beautiful** **deep** **scarlet** **color** **,** **with** **a** **thick** **tan** **head** **.** **the** **head** **lasted** a long time . lots of pine hop aroma , with a some caramel malt and a touch of oaky alcohol . the taste is thick with malt , big citrusy hops , and a little alcohol . i must say the oak aging really does it 's part in mellowing the alcohol and hop bite of the traditional ab . there is a complexity to this beer that is definitely not evident in the original . not a heavy beer at all , it easily belies its 7+ % abv . i could drink a few of these .
**pours** **a** **slightly** **hazed** **copper** **color** **with** **a** **pretty** **good** **off-white** **head** **on** top . keeps **a** **thin** **lace** **but** **leaves** a **ton** **of** **sticky** **rings** on the sides . smells boozy and sweet , with a hot fusel alcohol aroma plus some sweet syrupy caramel , honey , overripe peaches , and booze soaked oranges . really not loving this nose at all . there is some juicy fruit going on here but it 's soaked in booze and it 's overly sweet . taste is a bit better but this is definitely not a top notch dipa i 'm drinking here . it 's quite sweet , with a big candied fruit and honey flavor . there is some fruit , but like the nose , it 's not a bright and floral hoppy sort of fruitiness , but instead a sticky sweet concentrated juice sort of fruit flavor . it 's also pretty boozy and actually feels out of balance in the malt direction , which is surprising for a dipa . i do n't think the 75 ibus were enough for the hefty malt bill on this one , and i also do n't think they were well spent - the hop flavor is very uninspiring , with a moderate level of bitterness for the style . mouthfeel is quite hot but does have a redeeming creaminess to it . still , the alcohol in the back of the throat is too much . frankly , this is one of the worst dipas i 've ever had . it 's a boozy , unbalanced mess , completely lacking in redeeming hop character . i do n't know that i 'd pick up even a reformulated version of this , as this is no easy fix
**new** **penny** **in** **color** . i 'm sorry , forgive me , but i just ca n't get excited about amber ales with no hop aroma . subtle malt aroma , with a light hint of caramel and a suggestion of doughy yeast . you 'd think malt magician larry bell could come up with something a little better smelling than this . mild , mediocre malt flavor , which is very crisp , but overall husky . caramel and toasted malt flavors , with herbaceous , weedy hops . lacking bitterness and a pronounced hop flavor and aroma . this seems like an amber ale from a crappy brewpub .
( served **in** a small **weizen** glass **)** **a-** **this** **beer** has **a** **slightly** **dense** **orange** **body** **with** **a** **creamy** **tan** **head** that last for a sip . there is a gentle carbonation of big bubbles that glide to the surface s- this beer has a green citrus aroma with a fresh raw malt finish coming through as the beer warms . it was served ice cold . t- the juicy full citrus hops flavor has a soft grapefruit flavor to it followed by a sweet caramel malt flavor . there is a note of dry toffee to the malt as it warms and the finish is a soft bitter green note that really grows as the beer warms m- this beer has a medium mouthfeel with a tight fizz finish and no alcohol heat noticed d- this is a well built ipa with cascade hop flavors all the way . the bitterness starts to dominate other flavors but it has some good depth to the malt .
11.2oz bottle a- poured into a duvel **tulip** glass **,** **pours** **a** **golden** **yellow** **color** **with** **a** **huge** **white** **head** that takes up half **the** glass **.** **the** **head** **possesses** **amazing** **retention** **and** **lacing** as well . this is a very pretty beer s- the aroma is lighter than expected with some fruit , citrus peel , spices and belgian yeast . the aroma is very light but very pleasant as well . the array of fruits dominate the aroma with some citrus peel and clove . very nice t- the taste like the aroma is very fruity with some spices added in there with a dry yeasty finish along with some alcohol . m- the mouthfeel is light bodied with a high amount of carbonation . d- this is one of the better tripels that i have tried , fantastic stuff !
**pours** **a** **two** **finger** **dark** **cream** **head** **that** **fades** **slowly** **to** **a** **thin** **layer** **leaving** **a** **good** **lace** . **deep** **,** **clear** **amber/mahogany** **color** . grapefruit hop nose . light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied . flavor is malts and grapefruit hops that are really well balanced . nice imperial black . $ 6.49 for a 22oz bottle from manchester wine and liquors manchester , ct .
**poured** from a 16oz can into a tulip glass . **pours** **a** **very** **clear** **yellowy** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **niven** **creamy** **white** **head** . aroma has some lemony hops and some sweet bread . nice balance . taste is very clean and crisp . similar to a helles lager but this has some more hops to it . really beautiful flavors and great for the summer . the mouthfeel is medium bodied but light flavorwise on the finish . drinkability is up there and love the cans .
**i** 've never seen this in texas before so i had to pick it up . santa 's **is** **dark** **ruby-red** **in** **color** **with** **a** **creamy** **light** **brown** **head** . aroma is hoppy with some nutty malts mixed in . taste is a nicely balanced ( at least from what i hear about all the different products by rogue ) mix of tasty hops and mildly nutty malts . hops are diffenently emphasized here , but are n't overwhelming . mouthfeel and drinkability are great as predicted . so far this is one of my least favorite beers from rogue and it 's still great . pick this up
got this bottle at siciliano 's in michigan-a great store **if** you are in west michigan to visit **pours** **a** **nice** **copper** **color** **with** **a** **big** **head** **that** **settles** down to **a** **light** **foam** within a minute or so . the smell is nice hoppiness , and also a bit yeasty the hops definitely take over in this beer , with some yeastiness & light malt coming through too . there isnt alot of body or dimension to it overall as the hops seem to be the dominant feature-some dryness and bread hints at the end of each sip at the back of my throat goes down a bit bitter with a bit **of** **lacing** on the side of the glass and little carbonation i dont think that this is my favorite of this style , but i 'm glad that i tried it . i wonder actually how much better for me ( or the environment ) it is since it is organic
**frankenfest** **pours** **a** **clear** **amber** **color** **with** **some** **small** **bubbles** **floating** **slowly** up from the bottom of the glass . **on** **top** **a** **fluffy** **white** **head** **grows** **quickly** **to** **a** **2** **finger** **width** **.** **the** **head** **slowly** **dissolves** back to the **beer** **leaving** **behind** **lots** **of** **nets** **and** **sheets** **of** **lace** on the glass . the aroma is a bit faint and has pleasant notes of caramel malt , apple , peach and some grassy hops . each sip of this medium bodied beer is somewhat chewy with a firm carbonated fizz on the tip of the tongue . the flavor is mainly malt . caramel , toast and a hint of chocolate are present . in the middle there 's some fruity notes of peach . it finishes with a hoppy taste of lemon citrus . once gone a caramel malt taste lingers in the palate . this is an easy drinking , tasty beer . it would definitely make a great seasonal .
**copper** **body** **with** **some** **lazy** **carbonation** **bubbles** **floating** around **.** **huge** **,** **fluffy** **,** **rocky** **head** . it fills up your glass and sticks around for a long time . **leaves** **plenty** **of** **nice** **sticky** **lacing** behind too . smell is hops and hops . citrusy , bitter , earthy . this is really tasty . bitter and lemon flavors mix up front . this has some of the more intense citrus flavored hops i have ever encountered . next comes some more hops , as it gets through the bitter and has an earthy grassy flavor to it . rounds out with some biscuity malt . mouthfeel is a little bit oily , but the finish is a little bit dry and hoppy . this is a drinkable beer for sure . a really good ipa that i will definitely buy again .
**seems** a bit **overrated** to **me** . **pours** **out** **very** **pale** **with** **way** **too** **much** **head** **and** **froth** all over the place when i uncorked the undisturbed bottle . quite sweet with the whole belgium citrus/grain/spicy thing going for it . there are many better brews from belgium that i enjoy more so i plan to stay away from this pricey monster of a beer . but my advise to bas is to try it as most floks seem to like it .
had a firkin of this , 2010 vintage , at nerax at **novare** **res** **.** **pours** **a** **hazy** **amber** **orange-red** **colored** **beer** **with** **a** **light** **fizzy** **head** as usual for cask . nose has a nice tart sour fruit aroma , great tart fruits that just dance around the nostrils , berry , lots of grape skin , bit of brett funk and lactobacillis like acidic fruit , nice funk overall . taste brings a great funk and sour/tart fruit , berry , light sour fruit and sour malts , bit of brett funk as well , lactobacillis again bringing some acidic tastes , bit grainy and bready , and some interesting berry fruit with a bit of grape skin and seed . finishes with a bready malt , tart flemmy fruit , sour but not puckering , a bit more grape skin and dark red wine , and even a hint of oak and vanilla , hint of booze . mouth is med bodied , bit of warming booze and acidic feel , good carb esp for cask . overall awesome , so tasty , great tart sour fruits , sour malts , a bit bready , not mouth puckering or over the top , very tasty and nice funk to it at the same time .
22 oz . bomber , as seen **in** **the** **picture** **.** **golden** **yellow** **with** **a** **slight** **chill** **haze** and substantial amount of carbonation **.** **a** **thin** **white** **head** **that** **dissipates** **quickly** . **not** **much** lace to speak of . banana and clove aroma along with a honey sweetness . very smooth up front , despite the carbonation . not much going up front , except a hint at what i get to be turmeric . the esters make their way out in the middle and end . cloves predominate . on the sweet side in the end with a hint of bitterness . reminds me of a less sweet version of dogfish head 's chateau jiahu . alcohol well disguised , but a bit on the sweet side for me .
**pours** **a** **light** **brown** **with** **an** **orange** **hue** **.** **medium** **head** **is** **white** . generous nose - holiday spice indeed ... .ginger , cinammon , and the orange mentioned on the lable . christmas spices in a bottle . nice velvety mouthfeel . smooth , but full of flavor . great balance between the spices and rich malts . the hop bill seems turned up on this years version . alcohol warmth is also present . a significant amount of ginger , but not overpowering . great beer for holiday parties or just by a warm fire . lakefront has always produced a fine beer with this style , this year it is hoppier , a little less spicy - but still well spiced - and significantly higher in alcohol . a fantastic holiday beer .
**poured** from a 22 ounce bottle into a **wine** glass . **appearance** **:** **honey/golden** **color** **with** **light-** **to** medium-carbonation **visible** **.** **no** **head** , just **a** **trace** **of** **foam** around the edges of the glass . smell : what smell ? a little chlorine ? some old citrus taste/mouthfeel : nothing at first , but as the carbonation opens up a little , there are some citrus tones , spicy hop flavor . weird strained grain presence later on . very light on the palate , which is easily the best thing about this beer . drinkability : worth a try , but not a re-try . too bad this was a 22 ounce bottle .
**appearance** **-** **amber** **,** **clementine** **,** **orange** **colour** **.** **medium** **clarity** . light-medium carbonation **and** **very** **little** **head** **retention** . smell - mild orange , grand mariner , peppermint , light-medium malt , cinnamon and mild hops taste - very well balanced fruity with hints of satsumas , apple , pear , lemon . medium bitterness with mil aftertaste mouthfeel - velvety smooth with very light carbonation drinkability - good beer . very drinkable with no over powering flavors . not too heavy on the stomach so you could enjoy a few of these .
( served in an american pint glass **)** **a-** **the** **crystal** **clear** **body** **has** **a** **brownish** **orange** **hue** **and** **a** **bubbly** **snow** **white** **head** that is supported by a strong carbonation of big bubbles . s- there is a light tin note to a soft dry brown malt aroma and some mineral qualities in the finish . t- this beer has a smooth clean flavor with some soft sweat and brown malt notes followed by a dry spice hint . the finish has a soft bitter green hop note . m- this beer has a light mouthfeel with a tight fizz finish . d- this beer is soft and clean with little flavor but no off flavors .
**first** had : on tap at **their** **brewpub** **poured** **an** **orange-honey** **color** **with** **a** **small** **white** **head** **.** sweet , malty aroma , with floral hops and toasted grains . basically the same in the taste , pretty well-balanced , though not exceptionally flavorful . medium body with a dry finish , and pretty drinkable .
**cheers** **to** goblinmunkey7 for **half** of this beer review adapted from notes taken 4/2/11 note : written in my notes as 'legend of the **brown** **ale** . ' uhhh ... **appearance** **:** **brown** with **some** **hints** **of** **red** **,** **a** **nice** **,** **wispy** **white** **head** **with** **some** **lacing** smell : mostly uninteresting - baked/toasted biscuits , caramel malts , toasted grains , some earthy hops taste : not bad , not exciting - dry biscuits , caramel malts , some hints of burnt malts , grains - hops seem very english in nature - hints of nuts mouthfeel : smooth , a little light but it works , nicely carbonated overall : pretty boring but definitely not bad as far as brown ales go , this is a little above average . i would drink this again , but i would n't seek it out . i do n't find it legendary .
use to drink this from time to time when it was still called zoten , but just as good still . **a** **:** **light** **creamy** **head** **that** **fades** **quickly** **,** **light** **golden** **amber** **pale** **color** **with** **pretty** **good** **clarity** n : nose has a light belgian quality with some sweetness maybe candi sugar t : taste is light and ambery but has some belgian sweet candi sugar and a slight bitter aftertaste , it has a slight tangy quality m : a light to medium body that speads over the tongue with decent carbonation . f : it finishes a little sweet and bitter and lingers , makes you smack your mouth a little , not bad , but could be better i think , the two main flavors , belgian malts and hops , seem to clash , not enough belgian and too much hops imho .
**this** **beer** **pours** **a** **whiskey** **brown** with a touch **of** **gold** **.** **the** **head** **starts** **tall** **,** even and egg shell **white** , but fell to a **thin** **film** **leaving** **some** **spots** **of** **lace** . smells of succulent juicy hops with nectarines and tasty pine . underneath lies a powdery confectioners sugar . the smell 's simple , but it has me drooling . tastes of a biscuit dough and rye crisp malt with a tiny hint of honey that is hidden behind a tingly swarm of bubbles that distribute little pecks of grapefruit and piney hops . finishes with a bit of dark wheat that goes well with the lingering dryness . the mouth feel is really light and creamy smooth with a swarm of bubbles that nip at my mouth dispersing the dryness . this one 's really easy to drink and a nice change of pace for hoppy beers .
**this** **beer** **is** **very** **good** **,** **but** **the** **consistency** is **not** that great . about **half** the time i get , it is very **thin** and has very little flavor . the other half , it is great . it **is** **almost** **pitch** **black** **colored** **and** **has** **a** **nice** **white** **head** . it is very thick nad has a rather nice burnt malt taste with a little bit of a chocolate taste . it is one of the brewpubs weakest beers in terms of alcohol content . overall is a good brew , but they need to work on its consistency . it is offered at different times throughout the year .
bottle generously shared by thirstybird earlier in january . **pour** **is** **bright** **straw** **yellow** **with** **a** **thin** **,** **fluffy** **head** . nose is puckeringly sour , lots of citric and lactic notes , good earthiness , a touch of cereal/grain . taste is a fruit explosion -- pineapple dominates , peach/apricot and citrus follow , much less funk in the taste than the smell would indicate . mouthfeel is classic gueuze , good body and spot-on carbonation . will probably age very well . incredibly impressive for any american brewery to construct a gueuze like this . never bet against lost abbey sours .
**poured** from a bottle ( 1006 = 2011 , 6th day ) from the beer fridge at 45 degrees into a spiegelau stemmed pilsner ( tulip **)** glass . **poured** **3/4** straight , then swirled the remainder to stir up the bottling yeast for the final **1/4** pour . a **:** orangy-gold **colored** **,** **somewhat** **cloudy** due to the bottling yeast **,** **with** **nice** **1-1/2** **finger** **frothy** **white** **head** **.** **gorgeous** **matrix** **of** **lacing** on the glass that sticks around quite a while . maybe **the** **best** lacing i 've seen from any beer . s : citrusy and floral hops hit the nose first ( rose petals ) , with a yeasty biscuit aroma hiding behind . orange peel , mild grapefruit t : follows the aroma , citrusy/grapefruity hops prevail with a fair amount of non-sweet malt to back it up . hints of orange peel once again with a cleansing bitterness to finish it off . m : adequate carbonation to carry the flavors , cleans the palate up nicely and finishes very dry . o : a true classic . no aftertaste to speak of , the palate is left completely cleansed after each sip and ready for another . the hops dominate with just enough yeasty goodness to balance it out . everyone should try this at least once in their beerdrinking career .
22 **oz** **pours** **a** **dark** **ruby** **to** **brown** **in** **color** **with** **a** **lacey** **head** **.** smells of coffee , chocolate and a bit of smokey essence . taste is very thick and malty , like a porter should taste mouthfeel thick and a bit chewy , but that is to be expected . i could drink these all of the time in the winter months . a very good porter .
**its** **hazy** **mahogany** **body** **is** **topped** **by** **a** **light** **tan** **head** **of** **foam** that holds quite **well** **and** **leaves** **some** **jagged** **and** **craggy** **rings** **of** **lace** at the outset . the nose is yeasty and fruity above a mildly caramelish and nutty malt . the body is medium/light and its very fine , natural carbonation is lightly zesty in the mouth . chocolate and caramel mingle well together in the flavor along with a slight fruitiness , a light yeast bite , and some leafy hops . it 's well balanced by a low-key bitterness and it finishes short and dry with just some residual nutty malt . this is probably quite excellent in cask conditioned form , but it seems to fall a bit short in the bottle .
**pours** **out** **very** **dark** to the point of **pitch** **,** **a** **white** **head** **bubbles** like **uncooked** pizza dough ... smells of light **coca** **cola** and wheat sweet wet grains and roast sweet and sour immediately come to tongue with a split wheat flavor . almost a sourdough afterthought . not too complicated , but then it is not meant to be . without that semi sour tinge this would perhaps be a waste of time mouthfeel is light bodied with champagne bubbles you could drink these until you die because the flavor wo n't slow you down . it is a weak beer and maybe something to give to beginners to cut their palates on
**500ml** **slim** **brown** bottle , bb 10/08 , served lightly chilled in a pint-size weizen glass . a : looking like a märzen bier , with **an** **elegant** **bright** **reddish** **amber** **hue** **,** coming with **a** **well-lasting** **layer** **of** **creamy** **off-white** **froth** **on** top of **abundant** **streams** of fine carbonation . s : a good level of prune-ish sourness ( likely due to prolonged lager-ing of the unfiltered product ) , and caramelised sugary malt dominates the aroma , backed by apple-ly fruits , doughy notes , and a touch of dust like most lager-bier . t : a soothing flavour of lightly infused black-tea-ish bitterness precedes a loose-textured swallow of apple-ly fruits and floral hops ... turning slightly more bitter in the aftertaste , with plenty of mildly-flavoured herbal hops to linger as well as the prune-ish sour-sweet fruits . m & d : the carbonation comes so soothing and not imposing at all , plus the slightly sour and length bitter palate , this landbier proves a very easy-to-drink example of the style .
**this** **triple** **pours** **a** **yellow/amber** **color** **with** **large** **carbonation** **and** **a** **thick** **creamy** **head** **.** **the** **head** **diminishes** **quickly** **but** **leave** **a** **smooth** **layer** **of** **sticky** **lace** . the smell is earthy , but somewhat fruity ( cotton candyish ) with a hint of cherries . the flavor has stong hints of alcohol , with a sweet start and a very quick dry finish- like a wine . smoother and sweeter as it warms . the mouth feel is creamy and smooth with a somewhat dry finish . imho : the temperature has a significant impact in the representation of the flavor and consistency . i really felt i had it at the best temp possible when i first tasted it , and was somewhat disappointed . as the beer warmed it became much smoother , sweeter and well balanced . a pretty good belgian
**a** **decent** **flavored** **pale** **ale** , but nothing to write home about . **pours** **a** **medium** **gold/copper** **in** **color** **,** **slightly** **hazy** with notable carbonation . has **a** **thick** **fizzy** **white** **head** **that** **receded** into a **thin** cap halfway through the pint . nose is quite hoppy , lots of floral aromatics . taste is also hoppy with a thick oily malt body . the juniper isnt very noticable , slightly spicy in the aftertaste but i 'm thinking the hops really overtook the flavor overall .
**this** beer states it 's bottled after 6 months in the cask . i bought a 500ml bottle for $ **3.99** **smells** of some mild citrus and papaya notes along with some earthy , grassy notes . the taste is mild all around in flavor along with bitterness . there is some citrus and papaya sweetness in the middle and back . the hop prescence is more grassy and earthy the mouthfeel is really nice , **being** **both** **creamy** and **crisp** . the **aftertaste** leaves some grassy and wheat bread notes behind .
thanks to **kan** for sharing with us **a** **-** **pours** **black** **,** **mocha** **head** **,** **some** **nice** **lacing** **and** **retention** left behind after it all settled down . a very nice-looking ris we have here . s - chocolate , both dark and milk , slight dark fruit , oak , burnt sugars , some alcohol booze in there too and at 10.4 % , it 's going to be quite hard to completely hide . t - very similar to the nose . chocolate , oak , caramel , burnt sugars , some booze . a good amount of complexity between the oak , sweetness , and alcohol notes . very solid . m - full bodied , rich , smooth , light carbonation , creamy yet dry finish . d - one glass was enough for me . a very big ris monster . i have been looking forward to trying this and was n't disappointed after all was said and done . i continue to be very impressed with most ms offerings , this included .
bottle **poured** **into** **chalice** **-** **beautiful** **amber** **brown** **excellent** **laceing** **holds** **tight** and through . smells like up north - pine forest . some citrus . taste some of the citrus up front and finishes pine . mouthfeel is creamy and nicely carbed - really good . was expecting more citrus and less pine but this was good enough that the single turned into a multiple purchase on my next beer run . good drinkability due to mouthfeel and not overwhelming abv .
**samuel** **smith** 's old **brewery** **pale** ale . 12 oz **pours** **a** **deep** **and** **lively** **copper** -- similar to but darker than the samuel smith 's ipa . **wild** **off** **white** **head** **and** **sea** **spray** **lace** . a rich maltiness coupled with some fresh and inviting fruits -- almost candy-like . there 's a wonderfully tempered malt sweetness backed by juicy fruity hops . the malts are biscuity and the hops definitely have a nice bitter punch to them . medium-bodied and dry --  just as an english pale ale should be . it 's also a bit grainy , which adds some interesting texture . this just has such a nice combination of complex but mild flavors that it 's hard to stop quaffing .
poured from bottle into shaker pint glass . a : **pale** **tan-yellow** **with** **very** **thin** **white** **head** **that** **quickly** **disappears** **.** s : malt , caramel ... and skunk t : very bad . hint of malt . mostly just tastes bad though . m : acidic , thin , and watery d : not drinkable . unbelievably bad . stay away ... you have several thousand other beers that taste better to spend you money on . do n't be a fool like me .
had **this** on tap at **the** **all** **mighty** **billy** **goat** tavern in **mt** **beer** **pours** **a** **dark** **brown** **color** **with** **a** **nice** **off** **white** **head** . aromas are of dark roasted malts and bitter chocolates . taste follows the aromas . full porter flavors , dark roasted malts , slightly sweet creamy malts , and some slight coffee flavors . chocolate notes are there , slightly sweet , but not overpowering . mouthfeel is good . nice full feeling . drinkability is good . this is an interesting porter that is well worth trying .
**enjoyed** this 12 oz beer out of a **pint** glass . **a** **:** **pours** **a** **clear** **golden** **color** **with** **a** **huge** **4-finger** **white** **head** **that** **lasts** **forever** s : spicy phenolic aroma with hints of hops . t : smooth heavy malt brew with sweet spices and alcohol in the background . herbal hops and tad fruity finish . m : medium body and high carbonation . o : very sweet beer - unique - but nothing i would grab again .
**poured** **a** **clear** **orange** **with** **a** **big** **,** **frothy** **,** **white** **head** **.** **nice** **retention** **and** **impressive** **lacings** . very aromatic , with a massive grapefruit smell . orange rind and sweet pine notes are also abundantly present . bittersweet grapefruit blends with a nice mixture of hops . the aftertaste is dry and bitter . not as much bitterness as i would have liked and somewhat one dimensional with the citrus taste . after such a formidable aroma , i was a little disappointed . the flavor is not very different from middle age 's wailing wench . nicely carbonated with an excellent mouthfeel . this is a very drinkable ipa . i love middle age 's marketing scheme but i 'm disappointed with the mediocre tastes in so many of their offerings . this is another underachieving beer . it has a great deal of potential but the taste is forgettable .
**yeah** **,** i 've been sitting on this one about a year and i finally encountered the right time to crack it open . thanks to ostrungt for the bottle and three bas for sharing it at a ba gathering organized **by** crosling **.** **pours** **a** **one-finger** **brown** **head** **over** **a** **pitch** **black** **liquid** **.** no edging when held to light . smells chocolate and toffee with a hint of alcohol sting . coffee upon further examination . tastes sour tart black patent , but also sweet caramel and toffee . coffee is understated compared to the other flavors and i picked up either some falling apart grassy hops or some developing cardboard ( ie ; oxidation ) . dry coffee roasty aftertaste . md-heavy to heavy body and moderately carbonated .
on tap at **the** **brewpub** **.** **fizzy** **1** **finger** **head** **fades** at a **med** **pace** **,** **little** **lacing** **,** **clear** **yellowish** **slight** **carrot** **orange** **color** . nose has very light malts , some slight earthy and bit herbal uk style bittering hops touch of fruity hops as well . taste had a mild grassy slight herbal and touch fruity hop , a bit of bitterness that ramps a bit , bit of grainy malts , semi sweet . finishes a bit more bitter , light lingering hops , bit of malts as well . mouth is med to slightly lighter bodied dec carb . overall not bad , not quite the pale i was expecting as the hop profile is completely different , but tasty and done well.fizzy **1** **finger** **head** **fades** at a **med** **pace** **,** **little** **lacing** **,** **clear** **yellowish** **slight** **carrot** **orange** **color** .
**poured** **out** **deep** **dark** **brown** **with** **a** **nice** **head** **that** **quickly** **disappears** . the aroma is of slight roasted malt and deep chocolate . taste was of slight roasted malt and wham chocolate , lots of it . very smooth both on taste and finsih . like a hershey bar
**this** **beer** **is** **a** beer for everycollege student or person **who** **needs** beer . this is a beer **everybody** and there father has tried . the taste is **generic** **,** **like** **almost** **any** **mass** **produced** **beer** . but it is beer and it does have taste , not that great but it does have **taste** **.** **color** lioght **amber** , to me this product is made for the masses and not for the beer lovers . imo it is a 'do you want to get drunk tonite and i have little money beer ' and ' oh no we are having company i have to run down to the deli to get some beer ' beer . but it is still beer ,
**pretty** **f'in** **good** **!** **smells** **like** **caramel** **.** **tastes** **thick** **and** sweet . reminds me of a hot **chocolate** made **with** **cream** **instead** **of** **milk** **.** **head** **is** **a** bid **thin** , but who cares ? so convicingly drinkable , with no alcohol taste at 7.4 % and very little hops . malt bomb . i better work this one off , so i can have some more . das good
**a** - poured from a bottle into a tulip glass . fairly **dark** , it is a schwarzbier afterall , but light still shines through . **a** **slightly** **copper** **hue** when it is held up to the light . s - hmm . a medicinal smell . not pleasant or attractive . t - i like the taste for it being a schwarzbier , but only because i usually do not like the sweet maltness of the german schwarzbiers that i have had . this does not have any sweetness to it , which i like m - very carbonated d - the smell seemed to die off as i drank the glass so it was not as off-putting as the first few drinks were . the carbonation was annoying too . still , i liked the taste .
on-tap at sixpoint/jimmy 's **no** . **43** **vegetarian** **beer** **dinner** **a** **:** **pours** **a** **dark** **amber** **with** **a** **one-finger** **head** **that** **fades** **to** **nice** **lace** . s : roast malt with strong american hop scent t : although a brown ale , this tastes remarkably much like a stout ( which is one of my favorite styles ) . it 's of course less creamy , but the roast profile reminds me of guiness or beamish . m : i felt this was a tad too carbonated . i 'd love to be able to try this as a cask ale d : very drinkable . in fact , i ordered another pint of it .
**i** 'm drinking the first release of cave aged hennepin from 2001 , bottle # 2825 of 3360 in celebration of the birth of **my** **beautiful** daughter sadie . the cork was very hard to get out , but when it went it went with an **audible** **pop** . **it** **pours** **a** **golden** **orange** **with** **a** **huge** **white** **head** **that** **fades** to a 0.5cm coating on the top of the beer . the aroma is floral , spicy ( coriander and clove ) with strong hints of orange peel . taste is spicy , slightly sour , hoppy and pergaps a bit of clover honey . slightly slick mouthfeel , with a warming alcohol finish . extremely smooth and drinkable , and seems to have mellowed with its time in the cave and the cellar . a great celebratory drink and if you can find the 2001 edition , you 'll be happy you did .
12oz bottle into a pint glass . **a** **-** **deep** **amber** **/** **dark** **copper** **with** **a** **small** **head** **that** **leaves** **a** **tight** **ring** after each sip . s - sweet and complex malt up front with a mild spice/hop background . t - incredible balance here . sweet caramels and bread notes finish with citrus bite and pine aftertaste . the 11 % abv is completely unnoticed m - moderate body and only slightly under-carbonated for my taste . leaves a mild oil coating . d - for 11 % , this one has a very high drinkability . you might even think you 'll live forever
**pours** **dark** **orange** **with** **white** **head** **resting** on top . aroma of citrus , light fruit , and kiwi . flavors of light fruit and citrus constant with some pears that pass through as well . a spritzy drink with a light body that is very sessionable . this is not a typical autumn ale but is still worth a try .
**yellow/gold** **appearance** **and** not much **of** **a** head - i poured it when it was probably too cold . floral smell with orange and citrus . bitter taste of vinegar reminiscent of some flemish ales . a bit of a funky yeast . lightly sweet malts fairly inconspicuous . coriander present throughout . dry finish . light body , good carbonation . interesting brew worth trying .
**this** beer is hard to find on ba , **because** as **others** have noted , the us import bottles list a diferent brewery all together . thank **god** for the picture of the bottle ! **anyway** **,** **the** beer **is** **a** **darn** **nice** **looking** **very** **gold** **(** **like** a shiny coin ) . since i poured it , i had **a** **lovely** **inch** **of** **creamy** **white** **foam** , but alas where did it go ? aroma is probably its bext feature : rich , bready , perfumey . tastewise , it is not bad , maltyness tingued with some perfumey hops . the sweetness in the finish was a bit noticeable ... perhaps a touch more sharp carbonation would have evened that out .
12 ounce bottle acquired in a trade with pimpp , thanks for letting me try this beer , split with my roommate tonight **poured** **into** **my** **dogifsh** **head** **snifter** **with** **a** **nice** **deep** **brown** **color** **,** **a** **3/4** **inch** **vanilla** **colored** **head** **that** **stuck** around a minute or so , some rention **but** **not** **much** **lacing** smell had maple **syrup** , **butter** **,** **cream** , tons of different sweet malts , toffe , caramel , a hint of dark fruit , a tiny amount of hoppiness , mostly candy-like scents that lured you in taste was smooth and easy to drink for a scotch ale , tried to pace myself but drank it pretty fast anyways , everything in the aroma is present in its flavor , sweet malt all the way through with a little boozy character thrown in there , vanilla and sugar really stick out , some nice toffee and caramel accents , mild hoppy presence provides some balance , a lot sweeter than i expected overall but was certainly not a bad thing body was fairly thick for this beer style with a limited amount of carbonation , creamy mouthfeel that had a long lasting taste that kept me wanting more could not drink too much of this solely because of its heaviness and high alcohol percentage , very smooth for how sweet it is , alcohol is hidden pretty well and there is no single overwhelming flavor , a couple bottles would do the trick with this one another good beer from founders to add to their list of many , wanted to try this one before i popped open its barrel aged version , backwoods , in a few weeks or so , highly recommended and a damn good beer for its price , think it is available year round to boot , would definitely drink again in the future if i got the opportunity
**pours** **a** **dark** **brown** **color** **with** **a** **thin** **tan** **head** **that** **dissipates** **quickly** **.** **good** **belgian** **lacing** . aroma of sour vinegar and oak . taste is fruity and sour . lots of oakiness in the flavor but the sourness detracts from the beer not in a good way . finishes quite dry . carbonation is good , not a lot of alcohol warmeth as it is in the 7 % range . might be a lot better with some aging behind it .
served from bottle into a **delirium** **tremens** **snifter** **.** **poured** **burnt** **orange** **with** **a** **half** **finger** **off-white** **head** **that** **subsided** to a **minimal** **amount** **quickly** **.** **maintained** **nice** **lacing** throughout the glass . the aroma was comprised of sweet malt , citrus , citrus hop , caramel , and sweet alcohol . the flavor was of sweet malt , citrus , caramel , citrus hop , and subtle sweet alcohol . it had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation . overall this was a pretty good brew . very nice flavor and aroma going on in this one . the caramel sweetness in this one is a nice touch and helped to cut out a lot of the booziness that was present . very nicely balanced aroma as well . an absolute must try for any fan of the style .
bottle into a **tulip** glass a - aggressive **pour** **leads** **to** **a** **big** **foamy** **,** **bubbly** **head** **that** **dissipated** **pretty** **quickly** **and** **left** **some** **lacing** on the glass . its a **nice** **bright** **yellow** **color** **and** **hazy** - i could not see through it at all . s - very little smell . some lemons , some malt . nothing overpowering in the least . virtually no hops . t - again , lemons . the description on the website claims there are some tropical fruits , but if those are n't the lemons then i do n't know what they are . there is a honey-ness to it , which is kind of pleasant . d - drinkable , which i guess is the point because the bottle labels it as a 'session ale . ' it 's good , but not great . different from what i usually drink , so i do n't really know what to compare it to . i could drink a few of these though , no problems or complaints .
2007 vintage - i have come to the conclusion that many american barleywines , especially bigfoot , do not benefit from long aging . this is a style that emphasize both hops and malt , and if you age it too long , the hops will fade too much . **pours** **a** **deep** **burnished** **copper** **color** **with** **a** **big** **thick** **head** **leaving** **much** **lace** on the glass . citrus , pine , lemony , almost spicy hops , with a sweetish caramel-toffee aroma backing it up . hops dominate , but malt is well represented . alcohol evident . intense resiny hops up front along with a big blast of intense maltiness - kettle caramelization , perhaps ... very piney hoppiness . ethanol flavor comes in and makes its presence known as it all melds together for a intensely bittersweet hop-flavored finish . leaves an aftertaste of powerful american c-hops . mouthfeel : medium-full with medium carbonation . creamy with a slick feel on the tongue . drinkability - i like barleywine . this one is a drinkin ' barleywine - well balanced . i have really come to love this beer , and i now always look forward to picking up a case or two when it comes out every year . if sierra nevada asked me to pick a single beer for them to brew year round , this would be it - the best of both worlds , intensely malty and hoppy at the same time .
**a** **-** **poured** **a** **hazy** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **white** **head** **that** **leaves** **lacing** behind s - is fairly light but has a cranberry juice nose t - starts off like your average wit with wheaty malt touch of citrus but the cranberry really comes out in the finish m - this beer has a light body with high carbonation to it d - this was a very enjoyable beer i went into this one with some doubts but was pleasantly surprised it has a good taste thats easy to drink worth picking up to try
on tap at hopworks in portland **oregon** **.** **a** **:** **1.8** **'** **white** **head** **over** **nearly** **clear** **straw** **liquid** **.** s : the smell is peppery with hops and yeast . t : peppery , citrus , with a nice aftertaste . m : medium level of fine carbonation . o : a smooth and refreshing imperial ipa .
**a** **very** **nice** **ale** from cooperstown **.** **this** **good** **looking** **brew** **is** **a** **very** **murky** **deep** **red** **amber** **with** **an** **exquisite** **and** **creamy** **,** **tightly-formed** **tan** **head** **that** **retains** **beautifully** **and** **laces** with **remarkable** **gusto** . beer rarely looks much better than this one does . the nose is very nice and provides hints of yeast , fruit and spice , along with a very strong alcohol sense that seems higher than its rating . a smooth , creamy feel crosses the lips and provides a bready and yeasty sense very quickly . lighter notes of fruit and spice enter as each sip settles in and hints at a very nice complexity . the body is lighter and thinner than normally noted in this style . this is followed by a less than crisp , but notably clean finish . the drinkability seems quite good and i can imagine a setting with several of these consumed .
**appearance** **:** **hazy** **pale** **yellow** **in** **color** **with** **a** **short** **1/2** **'** **white** **head** **.** **moderate** **lace** develops . smell : grass and a faint bitterness is all that is detectable . taste : grainy malt , grass , a hint of honey and lemon zest , and a mild bitterness creates an average pils . mouthfeel : light bodied beer . crisp throughout with a clean but a bit dry aftertaste . drinkability : easy drinking beer that will do in a pinch . definite session beer .
**pretty** **black** **,** **little** **brown** **edges** **.** **a** **thin** **white** **layer** . aroma has light roast , molasses . some anise and licorice maybe . taste- it is sweet . i get a ton of molasses . some off cardboard flavors . finishes with sweet molasses , brown and candy sugar . bottom line , sweet . thinner bodied , the sweetness does n't thicken it up . not an easy brew to put down in spite of the low abv . maybe for getting a cola drinker into craft .
11 oz stubby . code on back **h.2.11** **cloudy** **apricot** **glow** **under** **creamy** **white** **head** **that** **billows** **up** **and** **settles** **into** **fluffy** **clumps** as it **falls** **.** **no** **lace** enticing sweet spicy orange scent that takes on a slightly metallic , marmalade tone as the level falls the beer warms more marmalade in the flavor with lots of orange and strong apricot tones . the suggestion of pepper in the chilled beer fades as it warms . tinny elements emerge with warmth . prickly carbonation in medium light body . faint resiny finish that lingers until after you forget it 's there and then it reminds you that it 's been a while since you had a sip . i think i short-changed this beer by pouring too carefully . that left a sticky pad of yeast on the bottom , which turned to be quite tasty . i still got a fair amount of spice , but it would have been much more distinctive if i had swirled up the yeast properly .
**i** had this on-tap at tank 's taproom in tampa , **fl** **.** **appearance** **:** **a** **deep** **amber** **body** with **a** **just** **darker** **than** **white** **head** **,** **good** **lacing** **with** **ok** **retention** . smell : very very pale malt aroma . taste : just like autumn . toasty malts with a solid hop presence . mouthfeel : very crisp and lager like . drinkability : good . do n't drink and review .
on tap at brixies in brookfield **il** **it** **pours** **a** **muddy** **brown** **with** **a** **quickly** **dissipating** **head** **.** **a** **small** **ring** of bubbles line the edge of the glass . the nose is very reminiscent of rye bread . it 's the most dominating rye smell i 've ever had in a rye beer . it 's just loaded with spiciness , breadiness and malt . i think this beer is now a benchmark on how much rye smell can be packed into a beer the taste has an upfront caramel sweetness to it that then transforms into this rye spicy rye taste in level which are present in the nose . a level of bitterness is there in just enough force to balance the beer from becoming a malt bomb . i 'm unsure of the percentage of malt used in this beer but it has to be fairly high since this beer is just dominated by this heavy rye flavor . i 'm really liking how aggressive it is and his beer screams rye . the carbonation is at a medium level and the mouthfeel is pretty full bodied which helps the beer feel like a liquid loaf of rye bread . it hides the abv perfectly without even a trace of alcohol smell of taste hitting my nose or mouth . it 's really a great beer that defines the style for me currently .
**poured** from the caged adn corked bottle **an** **almost** **dull** **yellow** **,** **cloudy** **but** **with** **a** **large** **foamy** **head** sweet citrus and malt , floral and herbal notes in the nose . yeast and bread also . very pleasant . the taste was dominated by the sweet and citrus , with a good balance of bready/yeasty taste . not very subtle , the taste of this saision can definitely be described as 'big ' . medium to light bodied , the sweet seemed to outweigh any other feel and faded too quickly drinkable for sure but not a fantastic farmhouse ; a good sharing beer and a great effort on victory 's part .
12-oz bottle poured into a pilsner . **a** **=** **slightly** **hazy** **golden** **liquid** **,** **very** **small** **white** **head** **with** **no** **retention** **,** **no** **lacing** . s = light spices , rough grain mustard smells with just a touch of tart vinegar , light notes of plastic though detract from an otherwise good smell . t = light banana , white pepper , lemon zest , coriander . quite a bit going on and all very well balanced . long dry finish . m = medium-light body , good mouthcoating , nice carbonation level . d = good drinkability , i found the sight and smell substandard but the taste made up for it and i could see drinking this one as a session ber on a hot day .
**pours** **deep** **brown** **with** **one** **finger** **of** **tan** **head** **and** **a** **little** **lace** . smell is roasted malt , fairly hoppy , coffee and chocolate , light ashy scents as well . taste is of roasted and almost burnt malt , bittersweet with light sour notes , coffee in the finish , quite dry . medium carbonation , silky feel , creamy , medium body . this was n't bad , fairly good drinker and a solid effort .
friend of mine is **cleaning** out his beer fridge and is **taking** **random** **beers** to random get togethers ... .i was lucky to score a six that contained a 2010 matilda . **poured** **the** beer into a tulip glass and so far like what i am drinking **.** **the** **appearance** **is** **orangish/copper** **with** **white** **head** **that** **is** **lacing** nicely . the smell is typical of belgium beers ... clove and spice . the taste follows suite ... .not much banana as i would have expected , but nice clove and spice that was n't tooo overpowering . the mouthfeel is down graded slightly cuz i do taste alcohol . overall this is a good beer .
got this one on tap at kelly 's olympian in portland . **lighting** **made** **the** **colour** **difficult** to ascertain , but i would be surprised if it were n't a very **dark** brown . came **with** **a** **good** **head** **which** stuck around , adding to the feel of the pint . i 'm useless on the sniff test in these smoky bars , so all i could distinguish was a malty cherry whiff . felt very smooth and went down very easily . was sweeter and more syrupy than i would expect an english brown ale to be . the smell did prove indicative of the initial taste , although where i expected it to give way to a somewhat hoppy finish , a thankfully subtle coffee flavour kicked in instead . i detest coffee , but this was subtle enough to be tolerable .
**not** really what i was hoping for after a **lovely** brooklyn **local** **2** from the brewery , but its not bad at all . nutty and oily , as promised , but also possesses a wonderful toastiness that really makes the brew . the problem with this beer is it has no backbone , no malty structure to expand upon . its a half-assed pale ale brewed with toasted pecans , which do instill a very nice flavor , but it is frankly not worth opening more than one . other than that , **the** **beer** **pours** **a** **clearish** **cloudy** **orange** **with** **a** **thick** **,** **retentive** **head** **and** some sweet , light brown sugar , light hops , and an oily sesame taste . balance is a bit off , with the backbone and nut flavors battling it out for supremacy . decent drinkability , but nothing special .
**very** **nice** **frothy** **head** **;** **great** **lace** **;** the color is **light** **amber** with a slight red tinge . the aroma reminds me of tart cherries ( not cranberries ) . the smell is surprising light , mostly a dry malt . i had expected a more robust aroma . tart flavors up front . the flavor of wheat is powerful . again , i taste sour cherries . not a true lambic , but pleasant enough -- probably not one i 'd re-purchase . long sour aftertaste .
**appearence** **:** **pours** **a** **crystal** **clear** **amber** **with** **a** **thin** **,** **bubbly** **white** **head** **that** **dies** **to** **a** **collar** . smell : solid belgian pale ale malt and hop characteristics throughout , with that perfect yeast tinge . taste and mouthfeel : rich , full , thirst-quenching , and smooth . very balanced and tasty , with the perfect mouthfeel . barnyard malt characteristics with almost pilsener type hops drinkability and overall : a classic . the perfect , easy drinking yet full flavored and full bodied belgian ale . definitly one that 's perfect for a session .
**color** **:** **bright** **yellow** **color** **with** **a** **very** **thin** **head** aroma : malt sweetness upfront with a tinge of hops in the nose . not bad taste : sweet and malty with some hop bitterness in the middle . goes down easy . a bit bready . seems drinkable mouthfeel : dry and not too sweet . the hops balance out the sweetness . i 'm not much for describing lagers but i like this one . drinkability : decent lawnmower beer . you should drink this instead of pbr . it 's smooth , refreshing and inoffensive . i do n't normally drink lagers but i would drink this again if i could find it easier .
08/26/09- purchased at bottle barn in santa rosa , ca . presentation- not sure what size bottle this was ... .maybe an even 20oz ? does have a best by date on the back label . poured into a **standard** **pint** **glass** **.** **appearance-** **dirty** **yellow-orange** **colored** **pour** **.** the **slightest** **of** head ( **less** **than** **1/4** **inch** for sure ) . **leaves** **some** **ultra** **light** **watery** **lace** **behind** . smell- a touch or cardboard , some sweetend tropical fruit notes and some toasted caramel malts . taste- thankfully the cardboard is gone . pretty heavy on the tropical fruit flavored hops ... a bit overly sweet . a light grainy toasted malt flavor . gets better as you work through the beer . mouthfeel- very lightly carbonated ... not really cask-like , i think just bad bottle conditioning..just enough to make it decent . drinkability- was hoping for better ... glad i paid only $ 5.99 for this bottle than the regualr almost $ 10 that i see it for everywhere else . hopefully their dipa is better .
**there** **is** a joke that goes around western michigan that says dont drink too much oberon u will regret it the next day ... not necessarily because of the hangover but because of your stupid actions the night before due to being so hammered . oberon has to be one of the strongest summer beers ive ever tried thus deserving it some due respect ... however bells brewery in general is another story.. apparently the market in the michigan area is weak enough that bells can be so **arrogant** as to state on the bottom of their six pack that they dont care about peoples criticism of their beers.. well being from the great northwest , land of microbrews , i must say that oberon is the only beer bells produces that even comes close to par with our local brews.. bells reminds me of a small version of redhook ... their product line is mediocre in general . in my humble opinion oberon is the only exception to this statement ... it is definately worth a try if you like heavy strong beers , especially for something different during the summer
**a-** **pours** **out** **a** **nice** **brown** **color-** **like** **the** **color** of **black** **cherry** **wood** **.** **not** **much** **head** , and **not** **much** **lacing** . s- warm bready notes , like freshly baked puffy whole wheat bread . a touch of fruitiness , and a touch of alcohol . t- quite a complex taste which is greatly appealing to my tongue . there 's a strong malt presence . and then some fruit swoops in from the wings- cherry , like kirsch . very well blended . and then the aftertaste lingers on as the malt subsides , and the cherries take over , using the power of alcohols . m- too sharp for my taste , and though the bitterness in the aftertaste is okay , i would prefer more while i 'm tasting . d- delicious tasting and i would happily have another .
**do** **n't** **eat** **yellow** **snow** . snowstorm **pours** **a** **very** **crystal** **copper** **color** **with** **slight** **brown** **and** **red** **hues** **.** **a** **good** **foam** that remains throughout **but** **limited** lacing overall . the smell is toasted with a touch of bready and toffee undertones . some bubblegum sweet hops mixes nicely with a warmer spice such as cinnamon and cloves . the taste has lighter malt tasting then the nose would kick up . a more roasted and astringent taste but a light taste that is n't quiet watery , but close . some caramel and toffee finishes the malt taste but fails to mask the heavier roasted flavors . the hops are not very noticeable . i would have also like to see more of the yeast flavor come out more . this is n't as smooth as an altbeer should be . the yeast is not really noticeable and the malt leaves too much aftertaste kick . very easy to drink but missed the mark for style . it has the advantage of not being yellow so drink away .
**i** 'm not sure where this appeared from in january , but i 'm **not** complaining . i had a pint ( low-head ) with **my** **soup** and pizza at liberty st . the hops have died down a bit since october , but this is still about the hoppiest pumpkin ale you can find . it starts with big **,** **pulpy** **pumpkin** **meat** **in** the aroma and flavor which is followed by a bitter burst of citrus . this is n't the most complexx pumpkin beer , the malts never really came out . but i 'd say it 's the most balanced and certainly one of the more pleasant to drink .
**a** : **my** **goodness** **this** **beers** **color** **is** **great** **its** **a** **red** **mahogany** **with** **a** **light** **tan** **head** **lace** **looks** **really** **good** it kind of coats the glass s : light vinegar dark fruit and a slightly sweet smell also detectable very good and complex smell here t : taste is like the smell but not as sour as i would have thought if duchesse is a 9 for sourness this is like a 5 i shared this beer with a friend but i could have drank the whole 750 m : med mouth feel med carbonation d : yea i could have drank the whole 750 myself and i was not expecting that overall : exceptional brew with a lot of history behind it . i was expecting this to be good but this blew me away fantastic brew
**hmm** **,** **this** one **does** **n't** **seem** **like** **the** **same** brew i had a few years **ago** **.** **looks** **like** a completely different label too . this one has , **what** looks to be zeus on there , as i remembered the old one just had stone pillars . in any case , it looked ok . it was a little bit of a pale orange ipa with some decent carbonation coming through and **a** **small** **white** **head** **that** **fades** **quickly** . **virtually** little to **no** lacing occuring from this one has a light hoppy , flowery , and malty aroma that seems to be somewhat appealing the taste is alright , although it comes up a bit lighter than what i remembered this one being before . maybe it 's just me but it seems a bit watered down from before it was ok , dog .
500ml bottle , poured into an **erdinger** **hefe** glass **pours** **with** **a** **dark** **brown** **,** **burgundy** **tinted** **body** **.** **light** **,** **tight** **tan** **head** **forms** with about **an** **3/4** **of** **an** **inch** **of** **foam** **.** **fair** **retention** , **some** little **bubbles** **of** **lacing** left down the side of the glass smell , sweet chocolaty malt , some nice roasted aromas too . a few vanilla esters and a little hint of smoke also . lingering malt on the nose on the finish with a touch of yeast too , little bit of fresh coffee also . taste , spritzy chalky mouthfeel , lingering dark bitter chocolate , vanilla essence , slight spiciness on the finish . a little bit of dried fruit and a nuttiness , maybe almonds too . some sweetness too a very drinkable and tasty dark lager . i could see myself sitting in a prague beer hall with a litre stein of this and being quite happy

**i** had this on-tap at max 's . pours into a tasting glass **.** **appearance** **:** **pours** **a** **very** **cloudy** **,** **almost** **opaque** **,** **orangish** **color** **with** **a** **finger** **of** **thick** **off** **white** **head** . there is **some** **really** **great** **lacing** **and** **wonderful** **retention** . smell : tons of banana up front with some malt and mild herbal flavors . reminds me a bit of banana runts . taste : very sweet with tons of banana , just like the smell . mild amount of alcohol and a sweet finish . i 'm not getting a whole lot from the nelson hops . mouthfeel : medium body with extremely smooth carbonation . the finish starts out slick , and then there is a slight dryness as well . this is one of the best feeling beers i 've ever have . overall : i hardly ever score overall higher than taste , but something drew me to this beer . i liked the beer as a whole better than the taste . it does n't make sense to me either .
**a** **:** **poured** **a** **near** **opaque** **mahogany** **red** **with** **a** **thin** **sudsy** **dark** **khaki** **head** s : chinook hopping provided pungent dry grapefruit and pine hopping t : malty , dark roasted coffee backed with a huge grapefruit and pine hopping . the flavor was clean , fading quickly after the swallow . there was some dark chocolate , dried citrus and a very rich roasted backing of bitter black coffee . m : moderately full , oily with a warm roasted nature , and softly carbonated that made for a pleasant experience . there was a dry **pungent** **grapefruit** lacing on the finish d : very good , a nice **coffee** **roasted** lacing provides for a outstanding flavor and great experience .

275ml 'nip ' bottle bought from beerritz.co.uk ... 2009 vintage **poured** **a** **deep** **dark** **brown** **/** **almost** **black** **colour** **.** **burnt** **brown** **head** **poured** **pretty** **thick** **,** **foamy** **and** **meringue** **like** **then** **faded** to **light** **covering** **with** **thick** **edging** **...** **some** **light** **lines** **of** **lacing** **cling** to the glass ... aroma - toasted bread and lightly roasted malts , black coffee , some dark brown sugar sweetness , roasted nuttiness , some blackcurrant , raisin and black grape fruitiness , very light oatiness , some faint smokiness coming through , leathery hints , faint whiff of alcohol ... taste - nice lightly roasted dark chocolate maltiness mixed with molasses sweetness , toasted malt loaf , definite coffee notes , caramel sweetness , again some dark fruits ( prunes , plums ) , light nutmeg traces , quite a lot of sweet nutty hints , some pepperiness ... feel - smooth initially then a little sharpness comes through ... pretty full bodied ... dangerously drinkable as the alcohol is pretty well hidden ... overall - a very enjoyable porter - perfect for a cold evening . may be a little sweet for some though ..
**pretty** **descent** **beer** **,** **pretty** **smooth** **with** **a** **light** **white** **head** to it . the taste is probably slightly average , but then in finishes sweet and leaves you feeling satisfied . i can see girls being attracted to this kind of beer . it starts out slightly too bitter but then gets better . its a good beer when its around cheap beers because they make this beer taste great compared to them .
**a** **:** **pours** **a** **brillant** **golden** **straw** **body** **with** **a** **good** **size** **bubbly** **white** **head** **,** **long** **lasting** **,** **spotty** **lacing** . s : pretty simple nose of sweet grainy malts , some saaz hops maybe , but a standard blonde ale smell t : sweet pale malts upfront with some light citrus hop bitterness , kind of spicy in the finish . tastes like a standard lager . m : light body ; medium carbonation ; smooth and crisp mouthfeel . o : this is another one of the good ones at adirondack . low abv makes it sessionable , and the standard and simple flavor pairs well with almost anything there . i would definitely get it again , but even though it 's a good ale , it 's nothing life-changing .
**the** first thing you notice in your mouth is that **this** **beer** **is** **thick** . **much** **thicker** **than** **most** **,** **almost** **like** **cough** syurp . the taste is of **carmel** **and** of **lots** of malt . it had 8.45 % abv so this is no 'sissy ' beer . when enjoying it , remember that drinking 1 is **nearly** **like** **drinking** **2** **regular** **beers** . the flavor takes a slight bit of getting used to . once you do , however , you will look forward to january-march each year when it is brewed . this beer is execelent with a fine maduro ( darker wraper for you non-cigar smokers out there ) cigar , like a macanudo maduro prince philip cafe or an **onyx** . hell , even a phillie black tastes better with this brew . cigars and beer should be enjoyed more often imho . and do n't say cigars are bad for you , your drinking beer are n't you
2008 vintage **a** **-** **poured** **a** **light** **copper** **color** **with** **an** **off** **white** **head** **that** **leaves** **some** **lacing** behind s - is of fruits upfront then some malt and alcohol t - i do n't know its not good but its still drinkable has a fermented fruit taste with a touch of malt getting by the fruit and alcohol m - this beer has fuller body with medium carbonation to it d - i think this would be easier to drink if i was in the mood for it rather than seeing it in the fridge and saying why the hell not this beer is n't anything to go out of your way to get
**the** pour into **my** **snifter** **raises** **a** **half-finger** **head** ( spread over a very wide surface , mind you ) that **quickly** dissipates to a lot of **light** **tan** **surface** **bubbles** **and** **a** **thin** **glass** **ring** **.** **the** **lacing** manages to be pretty thick and entrenched . the body is truly **opaque** . **i** **'d** **allow** **less** **head** **retention** , if the abv were comparable to most impys . the aroma is filled with an intense burnt caramel and molasses scent , accompanied by a blast of sweetness . the fruity vinousness is reminiscent slightly of shiraz , but also of the flavors found in chocolate over 70 percent . the taste , which i did n't get to until the glass spent some time warming , is vinous , molasses-filled , very roasted , and excellent . sweet in the start , but leaves a coffee aftertaste , very dry . the mouth is quite thick , and the carbonation is low , but still noticeable . an easy drinking and rich impy .
from a 1pt . **nitro** **can** with a blurb **about** **the** **cream** **ale** on the side of can , no freshness date . made your **generic** **nitro** **can** **appearance** **,** **poured** **a** **bubbly** **red** **amber** **with** **a** **pale** **tannish** **nitro** **creamy** **head** **that** **reduced** to **a** **creamy** **,** **thin** **lacing** . had a buttery caramel aroma with a little fruity hops in the background . nitro carbonation which leads to a creamy light bodied mouth feel , average drinkability . had a watery caramel and slightly grainy taste with a fruity , light hop bitterness showing up towards the end , then a dry , semi-bitter finish . drinkable in a pinch , not something i would normally buy , unless left with no other choices .
**aroma** : citrus , banana , clove , spice , bubblegum and **slightly** **hoppy** **pours** **clear** **golden** **with** **1/4** **inch** **off** **white** **head** flavor : begins with clean and fresh hops , then becomes spicy and peppery . the hops are piney and spicy . slightly dry finish . the finish is also kind of watery and bland mouthfeel : medium bodied . **some** **lacing** and a **persistent** head drinkability : medium-low to medium overall : just ok . nothing special but not bad either . worth the try .
acquired from samueljackson45 via loko4locals so a big thank you goes out to him poured into a pint glass a : **this** **beer** **pours** **a** **beautiful** **deep** **,** **translucent** **copper** **,** **with** **an** **off** **white** **head** **.** **head** **recedes** **quickly** **leaving** **spotty** **lacing** on the glass . s : nose is completely apple cider ... nothing but apple and on a good dau , apple cider . t : taste is ... . i 'm sorry apple cider . it 's fabulous and wonderful and i would drink it constantly but it 's just apple beer that does n't taste like beer . it literally tastes like apple **juice** , . m : lighter side of medium body , low carbonation , crisp and clean . o : goes down very easy , tasty , not filling , low kick , decent representation of style . this is n't a beer . it 's a great lil drink though i feel more goes in the line of cider than beer ... .but i would hit it up again .
thanks kevin for the opportunity to try **this** **brew** **a-** **pours** **with** **a** **crazy** **,** **foamy** **,** **3** **finger+** **white** **head** **which** **eventually** **settles** **to** **1** **finger** **and** **some** **lacing** **left** behind . body is a **nearly** **transparent** **golden** **yellow** **hue** **.** s- vinegar , lemon , acidic tartness , vanilla , and oak . nose overall is very balanced between these characters and very good . t- taste is the epitome of a gueze . hints of sour lemon , acidic tartness and nice backbone of oak and vanilla . finish is conistent with initial flavor but slightly more tart and slightly dry m- very good . smooth with soft carbonation . body is lightweight and slightly yeasty . d- this is an awsesome beer overall and pretty much what i think of when i think of a great classic gueze . i see why this is the example to compare the rest of the style too . i am looking forward to having this again
from an 11.2oz bottle with no freshness date , **it** **pour** **a** **pale** **straw** **color** **.** **the** **three-finger** **head** is large **and** **creamy** **,** **forming** **a** **stiff** **foam** dome extending beyond the rim of my pils glass . **it** **shows** **great** **retention** **and** **strands** **of** **lace** **cling** **in** **web-like** patterns . the smell is of grain and hops , with a bit of lemon peel and strong herbal notes . the flavor profile follows the smell , and the hops are n't overbearing . the mouth is light and clean , and after a burst of bitter hops , actually gets creamy on the end . this is a very drinkable brew , even if it does n't really posess a wealth of personality .
**appearance** **is** **a** **hazy** **orange** **,** **with** **a** **light** **white** **inch** **head** **.** **slight** **lacing** on the pint glass . smell is citrusy -- orange and faint traces of pineapple . the taste also continues the orange trend , with even traces of apple and apricot ( mouthfeel is slightly heavy , but not overbearingly so . drinkability is good as this is a very tasty beer and would be a good 'go-to ' beer if you 're feeling like something with a 'fruity ' flavor that 's not a fruit/vegetable style beer .
**this** **beer** **pours** **a** **very** **dark** **brown** **with** **a** **small** **head** **that** stays with you till the end the smell of this beer is very nice . kind of like root beer , with a splash of coffee in it . the taste is heavy , but it is light on the mouth . hints of chocolate , caramel , coffee . abv is not evident . very easy to drink . this beer was a pleasure to drink . i will look forward to having this beer again another day
12oz bottle into my **pint** **glass** **.** **looks** **decent** **,** **a** **brown** color ( imagine that ! **)** **with** **a** **tan** **head** . nothing bad , nothing extraordinary . smell is nice , slight roast , some nuttiness , and hint of hops . pretty much to-style . taste is good but a little underwhelming . toffee malt , some slight roast gives chocolate impressions . hoppiness is mild and earthy . just a touch of bitterness . pretty nondescript overall , but nothing offensive . mouthfeel is good , medium body and light carb give a creamy finish . drinkability was nice . i would try this again but wo n't be seeking it out .
**this** **one** **pours** **a** **nice** **almond** **brown** with **zip** **for** **a** **head** . the aroma is almost entirely malt , but i can also discern some sort of smokiness or herbal smell as well . this is a big lager beer , and i am surprised that i like it . but the flavor is a little too sweet and burbonish for me to drink regularly . i would love for heavyweight to do a regular lager as i am trying this style more and more and finding that it really can have as much taste as an ale if done right . and heavyweight does this right , but its flavors are a bit too strong for regular tasting .
**pours** **a** **very** **hazy** **orange** **with** **a** **huge** **3** **finger** **head** **that** **leaves** **beautiful** **lacing** . smells of hops and a slight whiff of alcohol and fruits . the taste starts out dominated by the hops followed by the fruits picked up from the nose . one the end there 's a slight sweetness and a hint of alcohol . you can tell this spent some time in the cask and it adds another depth to the already great taste . moderate/light bodied and low carbonation . i could easily drink a few of these despite the higher abv . this beer was a big surprise for me as i picked it up out of the reduced section at my local store . was on sale for 1/2 off so i figured why not and was very happy i did as this is one of the better eipa 's i 've tasted .
**decided** on a whim to have this with lunch today . **god** what a **mistake** . **suffice** to **say** **there** **was** **no** **lacing** , and it tasted like **lemon** grass and pepper . i admire sam adams for what they have done for the craft beer industry , but lament them for their lack of imagination with beers . their only truly good beers are that bullshit marketing 'imperial ' series that come in over priced 4 packs . **those** **are** **actually** **good** **beers** . the rest of their line-up is soulless and an embarrassment to craft beer .
bottle shared by bmannig , thanks **ben** **.** beer is the first bottled example from fullsteam beer **is** **hazy** **and** **kind** **of** **orange** **with** **a** **nice** **soft** **white** **head** **moderate** **carbonation** **and** **some** **lacing** on the glass . **looks** **good** . aroma is estery and spicy with a little bit of nutmeg or allspice and this spectrum of bubblegum esters , sweetness and breadiness . it 's smells good but there is a lot going on in the ester department . beer is nice , light in body , sweet up front , lots of yeastiness in it with some mild fruit . i do n't think the persimmon comes through very much but i can taste the fruitiness of it . it 's a decent beer , a good winter warmer for sure . i 'd have it again .
**very** **dark** **and** **frothy** -- no light escapes here at all . smell of molasses and alcohol . harsh , spicy taste at first ... think bugspray . it mellows though , to a slightly sour , chocolatey brew . mouthfeel is very lively/fizzy , kind of acidic , yet creamy and smooth . interesting , but i do n't know that i would search it out .
**i** **thought** **clear** bottle , strike one - but that was the only thing i found wrong here . clean , **clear** , crisp , refreshing ( do n't i sound like a bud/miller/coors ad ? ) and without the chemical tastes of macros or cheapies ( ah , therein lies the rub ) . what a mass-produced american lager should be . some mellow malts lending it a nice british character , and grassy hops to dry and spice up the finish . even better as it warmed out of the fridge - although it should n't be too warm .
**pours** **a** **clear** **yellow/gold** **brew** . smell is mild crisp toasted grain and a bit of sweet malt with some fruit in the smell . taste is a little sweet and fairly spicy . nice rich flavor and a bit buttery . mild toasted grain flavor and mild tartness with light hopping makes this a tasty brew . mouthfeel is good . excellent drinkability , a well executed golden ale . this is tasty and easy on the tastebuds . an excellent brew to convert a macro brew drinker with .
**pours** **a** **crystal** **clear** **pale** **yellow** **with** large army of **bubbles** **racing** to **towards** **a** **modest** **white** **head** . the smell is a musty sweet corn and light malt aroma . almost american macro-ey . the taste is a couple notches above the macro scene though and is fairly interesting . it unleashes a nice wave of black pepper , light fruit , faint malt , and a hint of hops . this is a light bodied brew that finishes slightly dry and it drinks down super easy ! i have to say that i enjoyed this beer and would have it again if the scenario was right
cool bottle . grabbed this 22oz at the local beer store . it poored well , **and** **and** **had** **a** **great** **head** . **sadly** , there was n't ' much detecable aroma . this might not be coincidence , as it had very little bitterness . the lagering produced a clean and full maltiness that 's delightful . the body is very full and the name is quite accurate . this is my first beer from siletz , but not the last .
**i** **really** **like** **the** **creemore** **traditional** **lager** **so** **looked** forward to sampling this offering from the same brewery after a friend brought back a tall can from canada . unfortunately , this one was a disappointment . **pours** **with** **a** **bright** **golden** **hue** **,** **clear** **,** **with** **a** **thin** **head** **that** **dissipates** **fairly** **quickly** . most of the aroma features malt sweetness , hop character is subdued . that carries over to the flavor , malt sweetness dominates , with the hop flavor and bitterness are lacking for this style . a bready , sweetish flavor features a medium body and lager smoothness . the descriptor on the can says their brewmaster visited czechlosovakia to study and replicate the true czech pilsners . sorry to say he missed the mark . this one needs lots more hop character and depth to make a true czech pils . not recommended .
**a** **)** **light** **golden** **yellow** **in** **color** **.** **pours** **with** **a** **thin** **half** **inch** **head** **.** visible carbonation from bottom to top . **big** **bubble** **lacing** s ) pils -esque in aroma . light citrus notes and earthy tones . t ) grainy . slight sourness just under the surface . mostly bland lacking character in the taste m ) crisp . fairly dry feel . light bodied . d ) a nice light and refreshing beer for warm weather days , but not a standout in terms of flavor and taste .
**great** **appearance** . this stout was good and extremely drinkable , tasted like 6 % not 12.5 % , that 's an accomplishment . mouthfeel was a bit thin and this stout had a very smoky quality , lots of burnt , charred oak notes . some dark overripe raspberry is in there as is some graham . nice beer and the mouthfeel was smooth , just needed to be thicker . this was more like an imperial porter/imperial stout hybrid .
**pours** **a** **cloudy** **amber** **color** **with** **large** **off** **white** **head** **and** **some** **lacing** . smells of hops and lightly roasted malts . nice balance of malty up front and a piney hoppy clean finish . more hops than i usually taste in a lager , almost pale aleish highly drinkable with smooth somewhat dry finish . not always on the brooklyn bandwagon this was a pleasant suprise . a hoppy ultra smooth lager that will please pale ale fans and lager fans .
presentation : 9.3 oz bottle . harvey 's christmas ale 2000 . 8.6 % abv . **appearance** **:** **cloudy** **,** **light** **,** **coppery** **caramel** **color** **with** **thin** **tan** **foam** . smell : a slight whiff of lactic acid ( perhaps a slightly off bottle ) was the only negative about this beer . otherwise , a sweet , malty and yeasty aroma with a hint of fruit . taste : rich caramel and toffee malt flavors with a touch of oak and spice , with a bit of hop bitterness in the finish . the hops carried over to the aftertaste as well . mouthfeel : rich and smooth . low carbonation . drinkability : very good . other than the slight hint of lactic acid , this was a very tasty brew .
**do** **yourself** **a** **favor** and shine the **beam** **of** **a** very strong **flashlight** **through** **a** **glass** **of** **fat** **bastard** **.** **the** **color** will surprise and astonish you . **fat** **bastard** **is** **very** **clear** **and** **pours** **the** **color** **of** **walnut** . but in bright **light** **the** color is **blood** ; **deep** **,** **lustrous** **blood** , like something gushing from steven king 's elevator . as a beer , it 's compellingly beautiful a fruit-laden smell escapes the contours of the glass with a dark puree of plum , apricot , fig , melon , and a hint of cola nut . no peat is found here though this will make a late appearance in the taste the flavor likewise reflects this fruited complexity and is comparable to a sedate barleywine . a slight syrupy taste and aroma are present though nothing sugary lingers at the lip . as the name might suggest , fat bastard is a heavy beer with a dense body , low co2 , and **no** **head** **or** lace to speak of . great to drink now , but some cellaring or cask conditioning might yield even greater polish .
**a** **:** **a** **hazy** **reddish** **brown** **with** **a** **tall** **thick** **orange/brown** **head** **.** **the** head sat **about** **a** **half** **inch** **above** **the** rim of the glass for a good 3 minutes . s : a very nice herbal , pine and earthy hop aroma . t : the hop starts right up front with some pine flavors and then the bitterness kicks in and fades to reveal an oak-like toasted and carmel malt flavor . alcohol flavor and feel throughout . m : medium-heavy body . carbonation is right on . a little oily , but the bitterness leaves the mouth somewhat dry . o : a nice imperial red ale . maybe a little hop heavy at first , but i like how there is a nice toasted/caramel malt flavor in the end .
**a** **slight** **disappointment** . i figured the oaking factor would start with ab as a baseline and add a great deal of taste and depth . not necessarily so . yes , slightly more vanilla scents and a bit more of a chocolate and roasted malt undertone than ab , but not hugely noticeable . bottom line : if you 're a fan of ab , you 'll like this one as well . not much more , and prob not enough to justify the added cost of this over regular ol ' dependable ab .
**a** **:** **a** **very** **light** **golden** **color** **with** **an** **extremely** **thin** **head** on a hard **pour** **and** **no** **lacing** on the glass . it had very light carbonation showing and very **filtered** look . s : has a strong apricot and strawberry fruit smells with a mild and pleasant yeast scent . t : the taste is kind of light in citrus and hops . i am picking up a slight yeast and malt undertone in the aftertaste . but it is mostly floral in flavor . m/d : the feel is light almost watery and lacking bitterness from significant amounts of hops . the drinkabilility is good in that it is light and thirst quenching . a decent starting beer for the night .
poured into my st . bernardus goblet . **pours** **a** **dark** **raspberry** **red** **.** **with** **a** **light** **tan** **head** **that** **dissapated** **fast** **.** **no** lacing in my bottle smells wonderful . raisins , spices , carmelized sugar and their special yeast strain . taste is wonderful . tastes just how it smells . the best part is the candy sugar and the yeast strain they use . very tasty brew . mouthfeel is perfect for the style and in the true tradition . everyone should try this beer . i will always try to keep one if these around for a special treat every once in a while .
ooooo hello citrus hops ! i picked up a few bottles for a mix pack of new **brews** **last** **week** and , not gon na lie , returned the next day and bought a fully qualified sixer of this gem . i got a face full of **grapefruit** and piney hops the second i poured **this** **pale** **golden** **,** ever so slightly **hazed** beer into my pint . the taste surely did not disappoint either ! the body itself was light and crisp , perfect for a summer day , and the hops are not lacking at all in this one . the carbonation was spot on as well imo . i normally do not go for american wheats , however given all the hoppy goodness lagunitas pumps out i gave it a shot . i recommend this beer the hardest part right now is finding it at other beer stores in my area . when i ask for lagunitas 'sumpin sumpin ' i get the 'ok yeah if you do n't know the name how can i find it ' response , no matter how hard i try to preface my request with a warning .
**poured** into **pint** **glass** **.** **nice** **golden** **brown** **color** **,** so-so smell , light hops up front but will linger . even would consider it somewhat lighter than alot of pale ales . thought price was good . got this on a recommendation . turn out a winner in my book . try it .
**pours** **a** **hazy** **orange-ish** **color** **with** **some** **yellow** **hints** **,** **with** **a** **white** **head** . in the aroma , fresh hops and a gritty grain . in the taste , a fresh , pine hop presence , with a malty balance . a bitter and medium bodied mouthfeel , with a fresh , dry pine hop in the aftertaste . a nice fresh hop and a bigger malt balance than though .
**a** **-** **golden** **body** with some oranginess to **it** **.** **nice** **full** **off-white** **head** at first that **settles** **down** **to** **a** **consistent** **foam** **covering** **.** **good** **lacing** . s - vague vinegar , an apparition of apple , hint of mint and just a little gin . t - sour , yes , but not overwhelmingly so . it 's a concentrated sourness that feels like it 's sticking mainly to the middle of the mouth before sliding down the throat . the vinegar flavor and slight sweetness brings to mind a combination of a white wine mix with an apple cider . later the sweet & sour mix covers the entire tongue . m - it hits just about every part of the mouth in the end . tart , but not tongue-curlingly tart . fuzzy carbonation tingles the nose a bit . d - the style makes for an acquired taste . it 's not really for me , but i can sip this one as well as any of the other top-notch tongue twisting styles .
growler purchased at **the** **brewery** **.** **frothy** **,** **tan** **head** **,** breaks down **fairly** **quickly** **to** **thin** **layer** **of** **foam** **.** **coffee** color . roasted sweet and slightly smoky aroma with a bit of yeast ; similar taste with significant wheat flavors and a touch of alcohol mouthfeel slightly thick but not syrupy ; to be expected for a double bock . very pleasant , quite drinkable ; best if you take it slow .
purchased from **root** cellar in cincinnati . bottle 0079 a : huge **pop** on **cork** **.** **pours** **dark** **golden** **to** **light** **brown** **.** **huge** **thick** **foamy** **,** **½** **inch** **bright** **white** **head** **s** : tangy , champagne nose with a honey and citrus under tone m/t : extremely light and watery body . cider quality , orange and citrus tang on the tongue . goes down easy and finishes very dry . no carbonation bite like champagne has . between the champagne yeast and the citrus undertone , there is no sweetness in the taste whatsoever d : extremely light and dry finishing . this beer is pretty sessionable and does n't leave you grabbing glasses of water .
had **a** **freshly** poured pint of this at the **raccoon** lodge . this one came to me with **a** **large** **creamy** **root** **beer** **foam-colored** **head** **.** **the** brew was a **very** **dark** tawny-brown **color** **.** **it** **looked** **great** . the aroma contained resiny hops and roastiness . not too complex . the taste was were it was at however ... .flavors of smokiness and licorice danced around my palate , while an assertive hop level pulled it all together . very well balanced . hop and licorice flavors lingered in my mouth eons after i took a sip . midway through my pint , **i** **noticed** **sheets** **of** **clingy** **foam** **coating** most of the inside of the glass . mouthfeel was full , velvety , and flirty . the drinkability was excellent . the alcohol was fully enveloped by the flavors . a very enjoyable and well-done brew ... i will be going back for more
big thanks **goes** out to the individual ( ca n't remember who it was as i do n't have my spreadsheet in front of me ) who sent me this one in a past trade ! 2009 vintage ! served from bottle into a mikkeller taster **flute** **.** **poured** **reddish** **brown** **with** **a** **half** **finger** **light** **tan** **head** **that** **subsided** to a **minimal** amount **very** **quickly** . the aroma was comprised of sweet malt , wood , very sweet alcohol , toffee , subtle brown sugar , and a touch of caramel . the flavor was of sweet malt , sweet alcohol , wood , toffee , caramel , and subtle brown sugar . it had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation . overall this was a fairly solid brew . the barrels really shined through on this one and made their presence known . i was n't expecting this as the brew had been aging in my cellar for this long , but was pleasantly surprised what i did find . a solid offering from great divide and i look forward to trying the bottle of ba old ruffian i have in my cellar to conplete the set .
cracked open a bottle from 2007 . definitely a bit oxidized , but this is a beer for which that works . **a** **:** **hazy** **caramel** **and** **orange** **in** **color** **with** **considerable** **tan** **head** **.** **lacing** **sticks** around for a while . could be my new belgium glass affecting that . s : the sherry from the age is prevalent , along with raisins and caramel . t : again , sherry , raisins , caramel . this beer is very sweet . just noticed that this is apparently 18 % ? if so , it 's hidden well . i would have guessed 10 % m : thick body and medium carbonation . very sticky . d : obviously , at 18 % abv , you ca n't drink too much .
presentation : poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a shaker pint glass . label is a sticker and shops a buxom pirate lady with one foot propped on a treasure chest . no freshness dating . appearance : **pours** **with** **just** **over** **2** **finger** **of** **light** **tan** **head** **.** this **settles** lowly to a thin **yet** **complete** **cap** **of** **foam** . the beer itself is a **bright** **mahogany** and shows moderate activity . some sediment remains in the bottle . smell : caramel malt with bready undertones and hints of butterscotch taste : oh god , this is horrendous . tangy tartness and sourness with a lingering bite . tartness is strong enough that it is reminiscent of a lemonade mouthfeel : average carbonation level . body is thin . drinkability : things were going well up until i took a sip . drain pour .
**poured** **a** **rather** **bright** **orange** **colour** **(** like a muted fanta **orange** **)** **with** **a** **fizzy** **bubbly** **head** **that** **disappeared** **pretty** **quickly** . smells very citrussy and sweet with wheaty notes . has a very subtle and moreish grapefruit citrus/wheaty beer flavour . very pleasant and refreshing . light on the palate and not too heavy on the fizz . is going down very fast . i could drink this all night could be construed as a girly alcopop type drink ( just without the alcopop tax )
**the** **beer** **arrived** **a** **clear** **amber** **golden** **with** **an** **off-white** **head** **which** **lasted** **to** **lace** the glass . the aroma was malty with a citrus base , mainly grapefruit . the aroma was mainly hops . the flavor was sweet , like honey , which diminished over time into a citrus ( grapefruit ) flavor and bitterness . the finish was dry with lingering grapefruit into the aftertaste and the body was medium , but seemed just a smidge lighter . pint at mellow mushroom in charlottesville , va .
16.9 ounce bottle . baltika **9** **pours** **out** **a** **clear** **yellowish** **color** **with** **a** **white** **head** **.** it **leaves** **an** **intricate** **pattern** **of** **lacing** on my glass . cloyingly sweet grain aroma with some corn . decent grain flavor . very simple , with little off flavor . alcohol is very noticable , and hides any flavor there may be . mouthfeel is a little bit thick . i was n't a big fan of this beer , but i suppose it could be worse . drinkability is poor . it 's no easy task to finish a bottle of this stuff .
**dark** **amber** **colored** **hazy** **body** **,** with a **tightly** **forming** **and** **sticky** **one** **finger** **thick** **head** **in** the aroma there is a massive cherry , woody , and caramel presence . in the taste there is a toasted bread quality , along with vanilla , cherry , and oak . prickly with carbonation , a bit chewy and surely full in body with a warm alcohol finish . altogether a great beer , and i 'm glad i found some of this . this beer should be revitalized and brought back into production
12 oz . bottle poured into a nonic **.** **pours** **a** **hazy** **golden** **straw** **color** **with** **a** **nice** **one** **finger** **fluffy** **white** **head** **that** **quickly** **dies** **down** **to** **a** **thin** **lacing** . stickiness is ok at first but pretty weak towards the end . smell is a sugary apricot/peach with a crisp lemongrass blended in . taste , wow , very tart and sour on the tongue at first ... almost like a lemon or orange sour patch kid . very different , not much alcohol taste at all which is just about the only good thing the taste has going . a nice pale malt in the aftertaste takes a while to surface , but it is enjoyable . mouthfeel is very light bodied with a whole buncha carbonation . drinkability lacks a bit just because of how tart it is , but it picks its self up with the lack of alcohol on the nose and tongue . give it a try , but i would n't go out of your way to get one .
**amber** **color** **with** **decent** **head** . a little light , not too **much** retention . aroma is fairly hoppy , but a little unpleasant . almost like old hops . flavor was most disappointing - decent pale malt backbone but a sour , unpleasant hop flavor dominated . no citrus , spiciness or floral , earthy hops - just sour bitterness . mouthfeel was fine . not too drinkable due to the poor flavor , though . finish was perhaps the best part , as the flavors faded to a decent , clean bitterness . i would not recommend this beer .
**aroma** **is** **a** nice mix of hops and **dark** **chocolate** aromas with some subtler fruity aromas mixed in . body **is** **flat** **black** **and** **holds** **a** **creamy** **mocha** **colored** **head** **that** **is** **thumb** **thick** **and** **diminishes** **slowly** **.** **lace** clings to the glass . fore is bittersweet chocolate with very lucious dark cherry notes in the middle . finishes with a roasty bitterness that reminds me of a scaled down version of gonzo imperial porter . i figured this would be decent , but it 's actually very damn good . definitely more aggresively hopped than most porters . that works well here and amplifies the latent coffee notes in the aftertaste . tastes much bigger than you 'd expect from a 6 % abv beer . excellent porter
12 oz . bottle poured into a shaker pint **.** **appearance-yellow** **gold** **with** **brilliant** **clarity** **and** **a** **moderately** **large** **white** **head** **with** **decent** **retention** aroma-sweet **pils** malt , light grassy hops , and a very faint fruit aroma of apples and pears flavor-flavor follows the aroma-light pils malt up front with slight orchard fruit esters . well attenuated-dry in the finish , with low hop bitterness but a rising hay/grass hop flavor . it’s growing on me as i drink it mouthfeel-medium body , moderate carbonation , and exceptionally smooth though this isn’t my favorite style , it’s a good example . it is incredibly easy drinking , and i liked it more the more i drank it .
**this** one **seems** **to** **skirt** the fence a bit , not quite a high enough abv % to comfortably sit as a strong ale , however nowhere in the ballpark **appearance-wise** to remotely be confused for a **pale** ale . at first the flavour seems more **like** **a** brown , but in the end enough complexity to nod back to the 'strong ale ' listing on the label . from a 500ml brown bottle , it **pours** **out** **a** **deep** **translucent** **ruby** **brown** **with** **bright** **garnet** **highlights** **.** **tall** **creamy** **beige** **head** **that** **settles** **to** **a** **thick** **tight** **cap** . toasted , nutty , waferish malt on the nose , subtle wood notes , very light crisp grassy hops . pleasant nutty , toasted caramel flavour , faint sourness in the middle from aging in the whiskey cask , with a smooth warm nutty and woody finish , slight dry caramel , with a lingering aftertaste of peat and smoke . the intensity is rather contained , yet this was still more complex than i had anticipated based on sampling the original 1488 . mouthfeel is on the lighter side , yet with a silky smooth texture that does the whole experience justice , and can easily turn this 'strong ale ' into a session beer . my lasting impression is that of a brown ale with more personality and complexity than they usually come , or that of a lightweight strong ale that nonetheless has some merits and is completely and utterly inoffensive . to step outside the boundaries of style this is a mild yet enjoyable dark ale , and one that i look forward to visiting again from time to time .
**a** **:** **golden** **color** **.** s : barnyard funk t : quite sour . strawberry grassiness vaguely in background . astringent bitter aftertaste ( tannins m : carbonation low to nonexistant . acidity means that body is not thin . o : too intense for my palate . the sourness and tannins are overwhelming . no body or sweetness to balance . and considering the price ( $ 11/375ml ) makes it a horrible value . sorry guys , i appreciate the attempt to make natural products in traditional style , but this does not mean that balance of flavour can be overlooked .
**intense** yet **smooth** **roast** **flavour** with **some** **coffee** **,** **black** **colour** . some quality bittersweet dark chocolate . also malt and licorice . good porter , not complex yet satisfying pint , well carbonated , fresh from norway thanks to trade with madsberg . medium mouthfeel .

**this** was **a** 'premium draft **'** **at** **applebees** **rich** **brown** **color** **with** **an** **nice** **head** **but** **it** **dwindled** **quickly** . nutty mildly sweet aroma smooth mouthfeel and taste . malty , nutty sweet taste and a really nice finish my friends and the waiter suggested this beer and i am glad i took the advice . i will surely be having this again . i loved it .

**dark** **brown/ruby** **red** **,** definitely **see-through** **,** **with** **a** **two** **finger** **fluffy** **tan** **colored** **head** **and** **very** **nice** **lacing** . aroma is nice mixture of sweet honey , chocolate and roasty toasty malts . flavor is an odd combination of sweet malts , chocolate being the prominent one , mixed with honey and a little bit of earthy spiciness . i 'm honestly not digging on this flavor profile . body is medium bordering on thin , almost too crisp with a high amount of carbonation . this is not a great beer , probably the most disappointing of sa 's brewmaster collection .
poured into a snifter with **a** **generous** **pour** and it **produced** **a** **creamy** **off** **white** **two** **inch** **head** **that** **settled** **but** **stayed** a long time **.** **really** **good** **lacing** . this is what what a beer is supposed to look like ! smell is hoppy at first then melds to semi sweet malts with some fruit in there as well . very aromatic with the rye coming thru as well . taste is a hoppy maltness all at once then the rye and a little bitterness at the end . got better as it warmed . mouthfeel was creamy and heavy . it coated the entire mouth . overal a very good example of a rye dipa . i wish i would have bought more . worhty of a try .
had **this** beer on tap at **a** **small** **pancake** **house** in amsterdam , it was served in an amstel bock snifter , .25l ... **a** **:** **nice** **amber** **dark** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **nicely** **lacing** **head** **...** s : smells of strong and sweet malt and a touch of caramel and grass ... t : wow , a very nice beer out of amstel . this is very malty and smooth but its also refreshing with a touch of faint hops at the end ... m : smooth , but a little under carbonated ... d : overall , a nice beer , one of the better ones i had on my amsterdam trip
**appearance** **:** **pours** **like** **motor** **oil** **,** with **a** **pitch** **black** **color** **and** **a** **thick** **brown** **head** **that** **leaves** **plenty** **of** **lace** smell : espresso and licorice , somewhat charcoalish taste : opens with a rich coffee and licorice flavor , with a powdered dutch chocolate flavor and a build up of smoke and hops by mid-palate ; after the swallow , the chocolate flavors become prominent and then fade into the smoke and hops again mouthfeel : thick and viscous , with moderate carbonation ; creamy drinkability : a really fine ris , with plenty of complex flavors
**poured** from a 12oz brown bottle into a **pint** **glass** **,** **two-finger** **light** **tan** **head** **with** **excellent** **retention** **.** **golden-amber** **with** **sticky** **residue** clinging to the glass . sweet honey smell . taste of honey , a little hoppy , nutty sweet , some toasted malts and biscuits and horehound . very smooth , creamy with some hop bite to balance it out . i could drink this all night long
**pours** **a** **clear** **golden** **color** **with** **a** **large** **white** **head** **that** **quickly** **settles** to **a** **whisp** **of** **foam** . a lot of carbonation bubbles makes this an **exciting** looking **ale** **.** **patches** **of** **sticky** **lacing** is left on the glass . the aroma is very subdued . i detect some sweet fruit and maybe a little funk and malt . has an intriging taste . slightly sweet and vinous at the start but a definate tartness in the finish . notes of apple , pears , and cinnamon . alcohol is barely detectable but there is a subtle warming affect . light body with a fizzy carbonation . an effervescent beer if there ever was one . a beer for special occasions . is it more enjoyable than a comparably priced sparkling wine ? i would say it would be an excellant alternative .
**pours** **a** **nice** **thick** **creamy** **head** that does **n't** **disappear** . aroma is wonderful piney but and clean clearly hoppy . color is **reddish** **orange** with a nice active carb . taste is very mild and well balanced with sweet malts and just right amount of hops -- good one for those afraid of harsher ipas , this one is truly right in the middle . creamy mouthfeel -- recommended
33cl bottled poured into a grimbergen chalice bottle number 03897 nov 2008 best before jan 2012 **a-** **jet** **black** **body** with **no** **light** **penetration** **.** **tan** **2** **finger** **head** **that** **reduces** **quickly** **to** **a** crown but **this** **is** **persistent** **.** **lacing** is average . s- light dark fruit sweet malt , peatiness of the whisky casks comes through subtlely too . t- delicate sweet malt quality which makes way for the peatiness of the whisky cask . neither flavours outdo each other . it has a single cream note - not sweet , just a savoury thickness , hard to describe.no suggestion of alcohol hot , very smooth . m- low to medium carbonation , perhaps a little chalky in the finish . i think this comes from this single cream consistency quality im getting . d- very nice , nice malt quality of a scottish ale combining with the peatiness of scotlands national drink ( not irn-bru ) . neither qualities overpowering . a lovely sipper .
**nice** **ruby-dark** **brown** **color** **,** **decent** **head** . **weak** aroma , slight sweetness , light floral scent . possible citrus element ? medium mouthfeel . moderate malt flavoring but kept in line with hops . slight banana flavor , a little bite on the way down but not unpleasant . decent brew , but certainly not the best winter ale i 've had .
**forms** **mid-sized** **frothy** **white** **head** **with** **good** **retention** **atop** **of** **clear** **(** **gets** **hazed** with the consecutive pourings ) **,** **golden** **body** **with** **uprising** **streams** **of** **bubbles** **.** **the** **head** **leaves** **only** **little** **short-lived** **lacing** as it **fades** . the aroma is marriage of peppery spiciness with citrusy , pear and apple-like esters , and candy sugar sweetness . the flavor of medium bodied beer is governed by substantial alcohol warmth acting in sinergy with prominent peppery spiciness ; esters are lesser than in the aroma section and citrusy in character . moderate carbonation and relatively high bitterness induced by generous usage of hallertau hops with spicy and grassy character ( the later indicating dry-hopping ) lend dry finish followed by bitter aftertaste . ( 330 ml , freshness date november 2015 , into tulip . )
poured from 22 oz to **tulip** **,** **nice** **clear** **reddish** **brown** **with** **a** **large** **light** **brown** **head** **that** **left** **nice** **lacing** smell is of sweet malt , spice , clove , brown sugar . well blended nice aroma . taste pretty much follows smell with the spices lasting on the finish . belgium yeasty flavor but not to the extreme , a little subtle . mouthfell is right on with the alcohol mask well . overall i am not a big fan of abita beers but i like this one and i enjoy this one often . worthy of a try .
had **this** on tap at tuckerman 's tavern **in** conway **a** **-** **nice** **reddish** **brown** **color** **with** **a** **light** **beige** **head** **.** s - light roasted grains , sweet malts t - similar to the smell with a nice hop bite . m - medium-light bodied , nicely carbonated with a light bite and dry finish . d - paired with a clam chowder it was perfect after a long day adventuring in conway nh .
12oz bottle . poured a medium , see **through** **,** **copper** **color** **with** **an** **averaged** **sized** **off** **white** **head** . aromas and tastes of , guess what , blueberries . smells like my wife 's blueberry pancake mix . medium sweet . even though it was one dimensional , i thought this one was n't bad . notes from 2/20/05
**saw** on tap in nyc and had to go for it a **:** **almost** **black** **with** **two** **inch** **dark** **tan** **head** **s** : had great sweet roasty scent with just enough coffee , not overbearing , but certainly not missing t : i love when a beers taste can follow the smell , and this one delivered . good balance of roasted malt and coffee with a bit of chocolate and just a touch of bitterness m : a bit thick for a porter , but i really enjoyed the creaminess of it d : found it very easy and enjoyable really liked it , and wish it was more accessible here
**appearance** **is** **light** **copper** **,** **thin** **head** **that** **dissipates** **rapidly** **smell** is very hoppy and the rye comes through very well . the taste is hops and rye , on the high side of bitter , but that 's a great thing in this beer . the mouth feel is my favorite part . very dry and refreshing , lending to it 's high drinkability .
presentation : 12 **oz** **brown** **long** neck with a sacry dog theme artsy label . no freshness date . **appearance** **:** **dark** **copperish** **brown** **with** **a** **light** **tan** **lace** that has no problem retaining . smell : butterscotch diacetyl , toffee and malt sweetness . taste : toasted malt , caramel/toffee , malt sweetness and light roasted malt are all in the big mixture of flavours . faint butterscotch and peat smoke in the backround with an evenly proportioned hop bitterness . notes : very tasty ... a well rounded brew that seems to grow on you . a beautiful malty profile that bursts with flavour .
new **glarus** **coffee** **stout** : in the traditional twelve ounce bottle , with the plain paper label , with a blurb about the beer on the side . **not** **too** **much** **head** , but what there **is** **a** **light** **tan** **,** with some stickiness . the color is **pure** **black** , with not even the slightest bit of light penetrating the brew . the aroma is a light , sweet coffee with a hint of molasses . the taste is very nice , with a very dominant malt flavor . despite the name , this beer is not dominated by a coffee/ espresso taste , but rather those flavors simply serve to round out , and give some bite to the roasted malts . very nice , smooth and easy to sip . a great cold weather brew .
poured into a 13oz . **tulip** **glass** **,** **mahogany** **to** **deep** **amber** **in** **color** **with** **over** **a** **fingers** **worth** **of** **a** **creamy** **head** **.** **lots** **of** **lacing** in the glass . an intense floral boquet of hops bursts out immediately in the nose a strong hop presence carries over into the taste , quickly complemented by a sweet caramel , roasted malt backbone , very brilliant and complex taste . there is a crispness and warming in the mouth , medium bodied with a slightly syrupy profile . the alcohol is definitely there , but it is n't blatant for a 9.6 % alc in terms of drinkability , this is definitely a sipper for me , i do n't think i 'd have more than 2 in a sitting . this intense brew is meant to be savored and cherished , rather than quickly consumed . amazingly vibrant beer , one of my personal favorites .
**pretty** **auburn** **with** **a** **cream** **colored** **small** **head** **,** **strong** **lacing** . aroma is a large lump of leafy late hops , big caramel malt and cherries . taste is a little pine-solish with some metallic notes that i get from many mass-produced beers ( saaz ? ) rather dry . boring yeast . fine carbonation level , but what is there seems kinda harsh . finish is n't very good , just graininess , pinesol , and cheezy hops . i am guessing that there was dry-hopping that did n't mesh well . starts off great . change the yeast and get rid of the harsh finish and it would be a really good beer . as it is , it is unpolished . my guess is that they were going after a more marketable snca and just missed the mark by a bit .
**a** **-** **light** **straw** **color** **s** - mix of grass and grain , more so as it warmed up a tad t - a little hoppier than i would have expected but after a couple of sips the hoppiness faded some d - i guess it 's an ok pils and it was fairly drinkable but since i am a huge pils fan i was somewhat disappointed . certainly will not seek out ... but what 's funny is as i have been writing this review it 's already starting to taste better
**a** **-** **pours** **pretty** **darned** **black** **,** **not** **much** **head** **,** **leaves** **of** **white** **ring** s - cocoa , mostly , sharp notes on finish t - nice muted cocoa , chocolate milk , cookies and some coffee . m - good carb and balance , aggressive enough to keep interest . d - a nice brew .
**a** **:** **poured** **a** **orangish** **color** **with** good carbonation at first but shortly fell flat s : sour , wild and tart cherries mostly t : tart of course but its dominated by fresh , wild cherries , sour and unripe cherries , vinegar , wood , earth m : tart , medium body , light booze sting and acidic d : good for the style and easy to drink .
12oz bottle , best before 9/09 , sampled 5/16/09 . poured into a shaker pint **-** **a** **deep** **rust** **colored** **beer** **,** **very** **cloudy** - creating a bit of a subdued , **hazy** **orange** glow . it also has **an** **explosive** **ecru** **head** that grows to well **over** **2** **fingers** **,** **then** **leaves** **a** **foamy** **fossilized** **lace** **pattern** **after** **the** **once** **proud** **head** has **settled** . **nothing** short of impressive , and a bit of an intimidating battle call . smell is a boom of grapefruity hop to the nose , delivered in a malted sugary package , some undertones of earth , and a warming silky alcohol that blends well with the hops to create a sharp punch . a taste that is involved and grows more intense as it warms . i let several sips sit and swish on the tongue for an extended time , and as the seconds go by , the taste grows more intensely hoppy . crisp and grassy up front . supremely sweetened malt lets the beer become full in the mouth . bitter , wild grasses show up again at some point in the middle and are almost overwhelming . biting , but this sensation is enveloped in that huge malt backbone to keep things enjoyable . some dry grains pop towards the end , then are buried by the final punch of oily earthy hop resin . the alcohol has combined again with the hop oils to provide some warm bitter pooling which coats my throat mouthfeel is thick , and heavy on the tongue , a product of the excessive hop oil and the heavy malt presence ; it has just enough sharp carbonation on the tongue to lighten it up , but still remains a bit of a chewy chore . a good beer to sip , a beast .
**appearance** **-** **blcak** **color** **,** **nie** **head** but then settled to a **pond** **.** **left** **spots** on **the** **glass** **from** **lace** smell - roasted malts and coffee smell here taste - roasted malt , some bitterness at the end of the taste mouthfeel - medium body drinkability - not bad for a canned beer . would buy it again , worth a try . easy drinking beer , funny name for a beer too .
**thick** **dark** **brown** **with** **red** **highlights** **.** **foamy** **light** **brown** **head** **.** hints of purple . **beautiful** dark chocolate backed with a bitter dry coffee . bitter first , then sweet at the end . sweeter than expected . has a dark berry , red wine hit at first . burst of balanced flavor as it warms . quite strong ; really bursts . berry sweetness in the aftertaste . thick and oily . a little burn on the way down . really strong but full of flavor and balance . a very very nice brew .
**yellow** **gold** **color** **,** **hazy** **.** **large** **white** **foamy** **head** **.** aroma is grassy , grainy and sweet . a medium bodied hefeweizen . malts are fruity and sweet . nice banana and clove flavor as well . hops are slightly spicy . well balanced . nice flavored hefe . light and refreshing . mouthfeel is full and round . finish is clean and smooth . aftertaste is slightly sweet .
**dark** **brown** **,** **opaque** **body** **with** **off** **white** **head** . nice roasted malt odors with a good vanilla smell in the background . tasty stout . black , patent malt with chocolate and a lot of roasted malt . the edge is taken off by flavors of oak and vanilla mouthfeel is a little thin for a stout , but fairly good . dominion is a solid beer that manages to integrate barrel-aging pretty well .
12 ounce bottle poured into atlas mason jar . **a** **:** **nice** **3** **finger** **brown** **head** . over a nice dark body . s : those arrogant hops and arrogant malts . t : orange-clover-beeswax , orange zest , lemon grass , bitterness of an oak sapling branch , caramel apples , and that hop bitterness that would make someone whose never tasted hops cringe , but is oh so good when you develop a taste for it . all this ends in a crisp dry bitterness . m : good d : this is a strong beer but i would say a sixer of a game of cards makes you a man . but only if you motorcycle home with a cigar in your mouth trailing a shower of sparks . a good cigar masks even this beers odeur .
10/3/2009 500ml **bottled** **aug** 31/09 **.** **pours** **a** **hazy** **orange** , and this thing is damn delicious . incredibly easy to drink and so damn good . not a hint of the alc. % at all . goes down so smooth . i loved the hints of grapefruit and bitterness to this beauty . worth the hype , and then some .
**translucent** **amber/red** **color** **,** **tan** **head** **of** **a** **little** **finger** **.** **lace** was okay aroma has a nice pleasant floral hop smell , nice caramel malts , slight sweetness . slightly nutty . taste is hugely hoppy . floral , piny , and resinous . malt , caramel sweetness . awesome red . feel is nice and creamy , full bodied , nice and smooth , good carbonation . overall , one of my favorite reds now . hop profile is great , and the malt backbone is perfectly complimenting .
**appears** **a** **light** **gold** **with** **no** **head** **or** **visible** **lacing** . little streams of carbonation make their way up to the top . smell is of a wheat based brew with apricot sweetness . man , this would really be up my alley if they had used a tripel yeast for this . taste is of the same aromas with a nice balance . mouthfeel is smooth with mild sweetness and a mild hop bite that is hardly noticeable .
poured into a pint glass , btw this is from 2009 . a - pours heavy on the **black** side with **shades** **of** **black** , with a **huge** **amount** **of** **fluffy** **light** **beige** **head** **,** **kinda** **looks** **like** the top of an **ice** **cream** **soda** . s - big whiff of dark molasses , maybe some spice , dark chocolate , coffee , and a tiny bit of sugary sweetness . t - big combination of dark roasted malts , hops , chocolate , coffee , and molasses . a lot of complexity m - medium bodied stout and coats my toungue with a light oil consistency . d - this is a very good ris from a great brewering company , i highly recommend this and would love to try the ba version of this .
**my** first in the 'epic ' **series** **.** **pours** **somewhat** **hazy** **orange** **.** **head** was not too **impressive** **nor** **was** **the** **retention** **,** **no** **lacing** . smell is dead-on for what a belgian should smell like . apple , pear , bread , yeast , and a touch of citrus ( stones signature i think ) . smell is great . taste is very good as well thoough i should note i 'm partial to belgians . sweetness hits you up front then you notice fruity characteristics on the sides of your tounge followed by a warm , slightly bitter sensation on the back of your tounge . carbonation is moderate and mouthfeel is medium , not too thick or thin . overall a great beer , alcohol content is well masked and a great belgian from the boys in escondido .
**poured** into a **perfect** pint glass . a : **nice** **,** **2.5** **finger** **off** **white** **head** on **a** **golden-orange** **,** very **clear** body with good active carbonation . this is a very attractive beer . s : smells of fresh , floral and citrusy hops . not overwhelming with just a touch of malt under it . very nice , but not mind blowing . t : hmm , not enough maltyness here for me , the hops come across a good bit sharper , thinning out the beer , making it much less nice . it 's still ok , the hops still taste fresh and good , but still too strong and sharp . m : ok , not great , but enough body to keep me happy .
**laurelwood** **has** **long** **made** **the** **best** **red** **ales** anywhere . perhaps it 's for this reason that fire road seemed somewhat disappointing compared to free range or bridgid 's irish - this one has a lot to live up to . fire road is certainly a worthy ale , but it 's far more gruff than laurelwood 's other reds . instead of the plush fruitiness that i enjoy in a red ale , fire road has an excess of bittering and lacks malt body . the 68 ibu puts more fire in fire road than i 'd care for still , i should n't complain . this is a spicy beer as if brewed with noble hops and tastes a bit like an overhopped esb . it delivers a spicy-floral aroma **and** **abstract** **lace** above a body of **clear** **dark** **bronze** . but it 's also a bit tannic and takes a little attitude adjustment to appreciate .
750 ml bottle dated best-before 06-31-2006 **poured** **a** **slightly-transluscent** **red-edged** **dark** **brown** **.** **fairly** **big** **light** **tan** **head** **quickly** **subsided** **to** **thin** **foam** **and** **moderate** **lace** . big powdery cocoa in the nose , but nothing else happening . sugary sweet cocoa and thin malts up front , extremely sweet and a bit dusty in the middle , slightly drier and very weak hop finish . quit thin and highly carbonated in the mouth . not bad , but awfully sweet and lacking in depth for such a high-priced special offering .
poured from 16oz bottle . **a-** **pours** **a** **deep** **,** **dark** **brown** **,** **with** **red** **tinges** **.** **1** **1/2** **finger** **head** **that** is fairly **persistent** with **little** **to** **no** **lacing** s- lovely roasted coffee aroma . sweetness and mild hops are also present . t- bittersweet , roasted malts on the front end . long , lingering dark chocolate and bitter finish . m- smooth , medium light , with medium carbonation d- the porter fan in me really enjoyed this . not quite as much roasted malt or mouthfeel as a porter , but enough to trick my mind a bit . makes me want to explore the style more , especially as blackened voodoo was my craft beer gateway drug almost 20 years ago . may the schwarzbier with you ...
picked this up at the foodery in northern liberties **batch** **ten** **pours** **a** **deep** **gold** **color** **almost** **amber** **with** **a** **thick** **white** **head** . aroma is a nice coriander and orange peel with some subtle hints of fruity esters . very clean no off aromas . very spicy flavor i get a nice hoppy bittereness that segues into a soft malt background . the spices seem to be coriander , orange peel and some ligt pepper notes , although the pepper could be some of the yeast characteristics and carbonic acid . mouthfeel is good yet it could be dryer for the style . maybe they should try kraeusening a batch to get that dry dupont bite nonetheless for a brewer with no brewery this is an excellent beer , it must be hard to brew on someone else 's system and produce exactly what you are looking for , still i would drink this again as it is a solid belgo-american .
overall , this is another average offering from **an** **average** **contract** **brewery** **hazy** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **thin** **tan** **head** **.** **decent** **lacing** **and** **ok** **retention** . definitely drinkable , the smell is very sweet , which had me worried for the taste . fortunately , piney hops dominate the buds , leaving a slightly oily hop finish medium bodied , a bit too big for a pale ale .
**appearance-** **it** **looks** **like** how it should ... .and i like the hand with the hammer . i do n't know why , it 's unique **smell-** smell good , better than it tastes taste- the taste is ok , it would be on occasion but not everyday or all the time . there is taste though which is always good if you like taste . it has a bannana taste to it ... it has a weizen taste to it mouthfeel- the mouthfeel taste is good , you can taste water and taste with carbonation ... but not to much carbonation drinkability- i do n't think the drinkibility is all that good ... but that 's my opinion .
**a-medium** **brown** **,** **light** **brownish** **head** **s-nice** **milk** chocolate t-chocolate notes are strong..also roasted malts ... finishes slightly dry m-medium bodied..creamy d-very good-to-excellent dunkel ... .love the chocolate notes ... an easy drinking tasty lager ... .well done ... easily the pick of the liter ... .
**i** was recommended **this** beer by a cost plus stock clerk in palm springs , ca . he claimed 'this is the best ipa **i** 've ever had . ' 'better than stone 's **ruination** ipa ? , ' i asked he lied . either that or this beer has **gone** **bad** **.** **the** **color** **was** **promising** . the smell was acceptable , although awfully malty for an ipa . but the taste ... i do n't even know where to begin . it tasted like a chemical spilled into it . was that clerk being a dick ? i 'm ready to pour this out . i hope this is just a terrible mistake and the beer has simply turned , but the store i got it from rotates their stock often enough to make me believe this is just what this beer is
**poured** from a 12-ounce bottle into a clear plastic cup at mt . view in naugatuck . a : poured **a** **very** **light** **,** **golden** **yellow** **color** **with** a slight **chilled** **haze** **.** **a** **thin** **layer** **of** **wispy** **white** **carbonation** **forms** on top . s : smells fairly grainy with a lot of fruity , lemon zest and juice aromas and little to no floral hops . t : taste is straight up sparkling wine ; like a chardonnay or pinot grigio with more of a malty , flat beer flavor . very sweet and citusy , not sour , but sweet and malty and sort of gross ... for the moment . m : mouthfeel is super light , a little chewy from he fermentables and citrus sugars used here . d : it would have to be a super hot day and very specific company to put this 'brew ' down . the saranac rep told me this 'chamblay ' style brew is made with **lemonade** and a golden lager . part of that is correct , anyway . sip and see for yourself .
**i** got this one from the always generous ba everetends ( thanks gilly poured from a 22oz brown bomber bottle into an imperial pint glass **a=** **this** **beer** **poured** **a** **hazed** **reddish** **cola** **color** **with** **a** **3/4** **'** **cream** **colored** **head** **.** **the** **head** **dropped** **to** **a** **skim** in minutes and eventually **disappeared** altogether . **only** **a** **few** **spots** **of** **lace** . s= this had a bit of age on it at this point , and the aroma was a nice meld of smoked malt , sweet malt , spice , and rye . t= big and rich flavors here . the smoked malt gave this a nice virginia ham flavor without overdoing things , and the spicy rye kicked in to complete the ham on rye allusion . very nicely done . no hops to speak of . the finish was pretty clean but leaning toward richness mf= heavy side of medium bodied with a tongue coating viscosity that made the flavors linger long into the aftertaste . modest carbonation . d= pretty drinkable , but the viscosity and the richness would stop me at one bottle every time . still , a very enjoyable and tasty treat of a beer .
11.2 oz **a** **:** **pours** **a** **dark** **amber** **red** **with** **a** **finger** **of** **white** **head** **,** **very** **good** **lace** . s : floral hops , very green , pink grapefruit . t : crystal malt initially , not overly bitter . juicy , almost wet hop feel . cantaloupe and melon rind , honeydew . m : tad overcarbonated , medium long aftertaste d : a good beer , i like the idea to meld all these different hops together . still looking for a mikkeller ipa to be worth the price tag ( $ 7 ) , but i clearly liked this brew .
**cask** **conditioned** **(** **at** **dogfish** **head** **in** rehoboth ! ) into a pint glass appears **a** **dark** **golden** **with** **a** **finger** **of** **foamy** **head** **smells** of bitter hops with little malt tastes great . a little malty and bready and pleasantly not too effervescent mouthfeel is great too but maybe it 's the cask . really bice creaminess overall a great experience and i 'm happy i 'm here . a reason to come back
12oz bottle poured into a **chouffe** **tulip** **sits** **a** **near** **pitch** **black** **with** **some** **cola** **colored** **edges** **.** **a** **dark** **khaki** **head** **rose** **two** **fingers** **and** **fell** **quickly** to **form** **a** **thin** **collar** . some minor **,** **delicate** lace . when i first leaned in , port wine and dark fruit hit me hard . fresh roasted coffee and bakers chocolate hold their own along with black strap molasses this beer grew on me the more it warmed . it opened up considerably . plums and cherries , port wine , fresh roasted coffee grounds , and semi sweet chocolate . well-rounded , not overly broad but very deep and rich . creamy , lush medium mouthfeel that feels a lot lighter than it really is . a moderate amount of booze lingers and mixes with coffee oils for a unique finish . a pleasure to drink . robust and rich but never overbearing . there is a reason why this beer is held in high regard .
found this at a local grocery store **that** has **a** **great** **selection** **of** **beers** **of** all types . purchased as part of a six variety six pack from schell brewery . **this** **poured** **a** **brilliant** **golden** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **1** **finger** **head** **that** **dissipates** **into** **some** **nice** **sticky** **lacing** . i thought the taste was lightly malty but sweet with a caramel flavor that dominates . i found it to be pleasantly creamy and not overpowering , one that could definately be a session beer . i have heard that this beer is fantastic when tried on tap .
bottled november 4th , 2004 . aged and consumed today , five months later . served cool from storage in my garage but not cold . hops now take a backseat to the roasted malts . the beer is as **black** as i 've **seen** **them** **.** **brown** **head** **began** **about** **half** **an** **inch** **and** has **dissipated** quite a bit and it now clings to the side of my glass . smells of licorice , tobacco , chocolate , and smoke . taste is more of the same , but with a more noticeable dark chocolate presence . age has not withered this strong stout . mouthfeel is solid as a beer this size should be . carbonation is adequate but not detracting from its drinkability .
**very** **nice** **reddish** **copper** **color** **with** **a** **short-lived** **tan** **head** **.** **no** **real** **lacing** aroma is nutty caramel malt with a touch of spicy hops taste is mellow roasted malt , sweet caramel , nuts and a nice hops tang at the finish . a little thin and carbonic but very drinkable and tasty .
**how** **is** **this** **not** **a** top-ranked **beer** **poured** **black** **with** **edges** **fading** **to** **light** **brown** **.** had **a** **highly** **brown** **head** that was pocky **,** **cavernous** , and popping and reshaping all over the place . **left** **dots** **and** **fingers** **of** **stain** **smelled** of captivating dark chocolate , calm and high quality roasty wood tone , some dark and roasted sort of spice , and faint molasses notes . smelled subtle and refined and well-done like a good wine . tasted of roasted barley , black and other dark malts , some thin fruit juice-like flavors , and great charred wood chip tones . nascently spicy , it had a finish of dark coffee but not too bitter and dry . also a fairly thin mouthfeel . don & # 8217 ; t know what to make of it : a porter with stout notes and complexity . flavorful and fairly balanced amongst its many flavors , not sure it gets much better than this . a stupendous match with dark chocolate . buy one .
had on **draught** at the frisco **grille** , columbia , **md** **.** **a-** **pours** **a** **deep** **brown** **,** with **a** **nice** **off** **white** **head** . s- citrusy hops and sweet malt . t- somewhat buttery , with a slight biscuit flavor . the hops are muted but balanced , no alcohol burn for a decent strong beer . m- smooth , nice small bubble and a thin to medium body , allow this beer to flow nicely . d- very well done , dangerously drinkable .
**pours** **a** **hazy** **,** **amber** **brown** **with** **a** **thin** **,** **wispy** **head** **that** **fades** to a few stray bubbles . pumpkin , pumpkin , pumpkin . strong aromas of pumpkin flesh with a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to complement . sweet pumpkin upfront , caramel malts in the center , with a finish of cinnamon and nutmeg complemented by a mild bitterness . full-bodied and smooth with a mild carbonation . the alcohol is so well hidden . the beer is a tad sweet but a light , lingering bitterness goes a long way for balance .
**appearance** **is** **a** **slightly** **cloudy** **orange** **with** **barely** **any** **foam..with** **little** **retention** **.** **i** **mean** **,** **foam** is there ... but come on . this is a wit . i expect more aroma is mild , but otherwise typical of wits . spices , citrus , yeast . taste is very creamy , with a bit of citric zest and spice . good yeast profile too . really impressive , actually . did n't expect to be blow away after the lackluster appearance . mouthfeel is light , very smooth , and very drinkable .
12oz bottle purchased as part of a seasonal 12-pack at shaw 's in windham , nh **.** **pours** **a** **crystal-clear** **yellow-amber** **body** **with** **a** **good** **inch** **of** **off-white** **head** . smells piney herbal hoppy with some rye to balance . herbal minty citrus hops play equal parts with a fair bit of rye and nuttiness . light to medium bodied with moderate to ample carbonation . fairly drinkable . i thought this beer would be less drinkable and more astringent , but this actually turns out to be a super ipa with just enough rye flavor to make it interesting
**my** first time giving this new 'brewery ' a try . this is actually contract-brewed by none **other** **than** **,** **duck** **rabbit** **!** **good** **choice** **wolf** beer co ... **pours** **much** **darker** than anticipated , **a** **deep** **orange** **with** **only** **about** **a** **half-inch** **head** on it . **disappears** to a just **a** ring around edge . **leaves** decent lacing/webbing . smells of lemon zest , butterscotch , flowers , and slight piney hops well , being brewed by dr , it brings with it that annoying quality that i find in all the other dr brews , the taste of metal . this does n't overpower the brew , but it 's there . tastes of bread and just a hint of hoppy bitterness . mouthfeel is decent . good aftertaste , like buttered bread . i could drink a few of these for sure . looking forward to this brewery making a go of it in the future
( served in a sam adams boston **lager** glass ) **a-** **this** beer has **a** **warm** **golden** **orange** **clear** **body** with a gentle carbonation of big bubbles . there **is** **a** **sticky** **cream-colored** **head** **that** **bubbles** **like** **pancake** **batter** **s-** this beer has a smooth pine and orange rind hop nose that is fresh but a bit light t- this beer has a flavor of pine and citrus hops with a light pungent green hop finish . there is a bright orange hi-c flavor to the hops that is pretty strong . there are notes of dry pale malt with a hint of light toast in the background . the note of light caramel comes through as the beer warms a bit . the hop bitterness hangs on a bit after the finish m- this beer has a medium-light mouthfeel with a slight watery texture d- this beer has a good flavor and bold hops while still very drinkable . the orange note in the hops is a bit strong and chemical in nature .
**das** **leichte** **helles** **'** **.** **pours** **a** **crystal** **clear** **golden** **body** **with** **a** **foamy** **white** **head** **that** **drops** **shortly** **but** **keeps** **a** **good** **collar** **and** **leaves** **exceptional** **lace** **throughout** the glass . the bouquet expresses a bright combination of sweetly grainy malt and fresh grassy and floral hops . the body is light with a gently crisp carbonation that caresses the tongue . the flavor offers a softly sweet grainy maltiness that 's gently balanced by moderate bitterness and a touch of floral hop flavor . it finishes short and dry . a lighter style lager that 's surprisingly full of character and quite refreshing . it offers all of the characteristics of a fine bohemian pilsner , but on a smaller scale . very nice ! this beer proves that a lighter , less filling beer really can taste great as well
**poured** from a 22 oz . bomber into a sam adams tasting glass . the aroma is biscuits , mustiness , alcohol , and a weak grapefruit scent . the appearance is **a** **slightly** **hazy** **,** **dingy** **,** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **very** **thin** **off-white** **head** . the taste is biscuits , butterscotch life-savers , and bitterness . the alcohol is not as prominent as i was expecting . the mouthfeel is full , with a bitter ( but not too dry ) finish . the drinkability is good . the strong bitterness lingers on the tongue . i do n't think i could enjoy more than one per session .
**a** **-** **deep** **ruddy** **orange** **with** **a** **one** **finger** **head** **that** **sticks** around for a while . **some** **good** **lace** graces the glass , and the amber-orange brew keeps grabbing my attention since it 's much darker than most oktoberfests . s - heavy pumpkin pie and thick scone malt notes , with an overlaying spicy sweetness that balances the pumpkin pie notes . t - super malty , but never overly sweet or cloying due to the tight alcohol attenuation and a lovely autumn hop note . some tootsie roll flavors are in there with a really nice almost chocolate taste . damn good stuff . really unique , but still identifiable as an o-fest . m - medium bodied with a hint of apparent alcohol , but as always ... .i appreciate a little warmth in my beers ( being a scotch and bourbon lover , after all ) . the carbonation is graceful and understated , giving this one a refined and classy finish that leaves lingering notes of pumpkin pie , cinnamon , and autumn leaf hops ( in the background , playing an award wining supporting role ) on the palate . d - i think everything i 've said above pretty much says it : this is good beer . note : after reading other , less generous reviews , i must say that i am a full time malt-head ( the scotch thing again ) in addition to my role as a part-time hop head ... .so i may be slightly partial to malt-heavy brews like this one .
**poured** this into a regular pint glass and my first impression is that it **looks** lighter **than** **the** **usual** **stout** **.** **a** **dark** **amber** **color** **generally** , but it allows more light through it than many stouts i 've had . the head is light brown with nice cavities and settles into a thin , but **complete** **layer** **atop** **the** **beer** **.** **lacing** on the sides of the glass . roasted caramel with hints of chocolate in the nose a tang of carbination gives way to a nice smooth and slippery mouthfeel . robust enough to warrent the stout name nice roasted character with a malty , sweet start gives way to a hop bitterness that lingers almost too long , eventually followed by quick hint of alcohol and a warm full finish . my only complaint is a lingering bitterness that may just be a problem because of personal preference . not the best or most complex stout i 've had , but certainly drinkable and worth a try .
**appearance** **:** **light** **yellow** **to** **almost** **clear** **smell** : slight hops , but barely smelled like beer taste : little to none , like a rice lager , zero taste mouthfeel : watery and tasteless drinkability : very easy , goes down easier than water . good for drinking games
**london** **porter** **pours** **out** **a** **dark** **brown** **,** **nearly** **black** **,** **color** **.** **a** **thick** **head** accompanied the pour , **but** **quickly** **disappeared** **and** stuck around as **very** **light** **lacing** . the aroma is full of roasted malts and chocolate with fruity notes peaking through . this beer is highly carbonated and unfortunately that makes it difficult to pick out flavors . a somewhat bitter chocolate hits your tongue right away , but give way to a roasted , smokiness . dark fruits surface when the chocolate flavor fades , and hints of alcohol pop up at the very end .
12 oz bottle for $ 1.49 at world market a : **pours** **black** **in** the glass , but when held up its really just a **deep** **brown** **.** **lots** **of** **creamy** **tan** **head** **that** **leaves** **big** **lacing** on the glass s : smells mostly of roasted malts and some hints of dark chocolate t : not enough coffee for it to be called 'mocha . ' the taste is the malts first , then the chocolate comes through , and it finishes bitter . very bitter m : what you 'd expect from a porter . d : i would be able to drink a few of these at a time , which is a good quality for a porter nice try by rogue , but it does n't measure up to bell 's or glbcs edmund .
tasting **size** portion at a local beer tasting event . served in a plastic **cup** . **a** **:** **pale** **amber** **in** **color** **,** **cloudy** **,** **with** **a** **small** **creamy** **head** . s : piney hop aroma . t : little bit of a piney hop flavor with caramel malts . not as hoppy as the name of the beer would indicate , but it does finish with a mild pleasant bitter aftertaste . m : medium bodied , good carbonation levels . d : reminded more of a pale ale compared to an ipa . of the beers i tasted from the brewery , this one was the most enjoyable .
**great** **look** **to** **the** **beer** **with** **an** **orange** **copper** **body** **topped** **with** **a** **light** **tan** **creamy** **cap** . lots of sweet malt and citrusy hop character in the aroma . the taste is toasty sweetened caramel malt , a hit of ripe orange preserves , and a subtle bitterness form the hops . not too complex and it does n't need to be . it is fantastic the way it is , great mouthfeel , just fills every tastebuds with sweet , hoppy goodness , heavy for the style and while very crisp , it is n't dry or over carbonated . you know when you drink an ice cold coca cola in the burning hot sun after mowing your yard , that feeling you get like : wow ! that was wonderful ! same feeling you get when you put this back . i continue to be impressed with lagunitas .
**pretty** **clear** **for** **a** **bottle-conditioned** **brew** **.** **head** **settles** **to** **skim** in 30 seconds . about 10 big chunks of yeast . lemony aroma , a touch of cinnamon . sweet and sour flavors , enhanced by aroma . senses of citric and coriander ( and even a touch of dill ? ) , especially pronounced at the mid and back part of the mouth . all the flavors are nevertheless mellow , making this pleasant but a little thin in mouthfeel . despite its use of coriander , not super memorable .
**pours** **a** **dark** **golden** **color** **.** the liquid is completely **clear** with **no** **haze** , but a lot of carbonation that creates **only** **a** **thin** **white** **head** **with** **very** **little** **lacing** . smell is of fresh hops . a subtle citrus waft with floral undertones taste falls short in comparison to smell . taste is stronger on the malt with a biscuit taste . the hops are very subtle and barely tasted . mouthfeel has a nice bite to it . very refreshing . drinkability is nice . a good american pale ale . i have had better and i have had worse . a good beer for a drinking session , but it may get boring after a while .
picked up this week at tj 's in cary , i thought it would be good in the hot **weather** . of **course** , that was before my wife set the ac at 66 **so** she can walk around in one of my sweatsuits . but **i** **digress** **.** **pours** **a** **classic** **golden** **lager** **coor** **with** **plenty** **of** **isible** **carbonation** **ands** **a** **mighty** **head** **tthat** **quickly** **cowers** **to** **a** **thin** **cap** . nose is yeasty with fresh , perky noble hops . good for the style . taste is initially overcarbonated to the extreme but then follows up with some solid hop bitterness that carries well into the aftertaste . slight metallic tinge . some floral notes . mouthfeel is reasonably crisp . this is not a bad german pilsner . nothing exceptional but worth a flyer for a buck .
serving type- 11.6 ounce bottle poured into a st . **bernardus** **chalice** **.** **a-** **pours** **a** **deep** **amber** **color** **with** **no** **visible** carbonation activity after the pour . **a** **nice** **two** **finger** **white** **lace** **that** **sticks** around pretty much throughout . a nice cling to the glass after the pour as well . s- sweet malty smell . t- the sweet malty flavor comes out again in the taste . the malty flavor hides the strength of this beer , the only hints you get that this has a double digit abv is the subtle alcohol taste you get at the very end of the . that combination could be a problem if someone where to drink too many of these . overall a very easy drinking beer . this is my final beer that i bought in a st . bernardus gift pack . i am not a huge fan of the malt bomb beers but this is not that bad . something that i would have again as a change up from the hoppy ipa 's that i usually favor .
**pours** **a** **dark** **chestnut** **brown** **with** **a** **creamy** **light** **tan** **head** **smell** of scotch ale yeast , nutty and roasted malts with caramel and a light butterscotch taste of roasted malts , butterscotch , caramel , faint toffee , some malt sweetness but pretty dry for a scotch ale , especially after having big sound scotch ale recently from ccb . there is a medium carbonation with a medium mouthfeel overall a good scotch ale .
**pours** **brown** **with** **a** **thin** **white** **head** **,** **quickly** **settles** to a film **.** **no** **lacings** . malty aroma . some tart berries , little bit of vanilla , some alcohol . a little bit of tartness up front but the beer settles down to a resounding 'meh ' . aside from some awfully english tasting malt , the aging has left a pleasant enough oakiness to the beer , but it 's very soft carbonation is far too aggressive , makes the beer feel quite thin not the greatest , might be a good intro to the style , offering some decent malt but none of the challenging aspects of a proper example of the style
**pours** **a** **deep** **dark** **brown** **to** **almost** **black** **with** **a** **one** **finger** **head** **with** **a** **light** **caramel/brown** **color** **.** **low** **retention** **with** **a** **quickly** **disappearing** **head** **and** **little** **lacing** **left** behind . smells of caramel-like malt and a presence of rye with a subtle hop backing . up front i taste rye and a balance of the malt and hops with a slightly bitter finish followed by an aftertaste mainly of almost a slight chocolately taste and hops . it leaves my mouth feeling watery and a bit sticky as well . overall this is a decent beer and my first sample of any beer by tommyknocker - not bad at all if you 're in to dark ryepas .
**overall** **a** **very** **nice** **beer** . served on the **nitro** **tap** **but** **the** **head** seemed to be a bit depleted compared to other nitros ive had . **great** **anyway** **.** **nice** **and** **opaque** **with** **a** **creamy** **tan** **head** **.** tons of coffee malts and chocolate malts as well . great coffee aroma . hints of caramel and toastiness . overall a great smell as well . tastes a lot like guiness . coffee , small bit of chocolate , a bit grainy and pungent at times . nice hop bitterness as well . i think the best beer at this establishment . a nice beer overall . i think this would be my first choice if i were to return here again next thanksgiving . part of the indiana thanksgiving pub crawl .
**appearance** **:** **crystal** **clear** **,** **ruby** **red** **colored** **with** **nice** **lacing** smell : malt aroma with some vanilla . not alot here . taste : ahh . wonderful balnce of malts , smoke , hop flavor , and the oakiness which in my opinion lend amost a cinnamony flavor to the beer . this is the best oaked beer i 've had . the oak is just a perfect flavor adjunct to the malt/hops balance of this beer . mouthfeel : medium bodied drinkability : if they were n't so expensive , i 'd be drinking these all the time . wonderful beer .
**we** decided this one tasted a bit **like** 'guiness **light** **'** **,** **poured** **a** **thing** **brown** **color** **with** **an** **impressive** **frothy** **head** . nose was spot on , all dark and bold , with notes of dark chocolate . flavor wasnt bad , but the mouthfeel left a lot to be desired . watery through and through with a very forgettable slightly bitter aftertaste . recognizing that this is a fairly new operation , i will give this one a little slack , but just doesnt measure up to what ive come to expect from a microbrewed stout . the good news is that it was very sessionable , as it doesnt sit in the gut . so so
**poured** **roughly** into **a** tulipish **glass** **,** **garnet** **,** **ruby** **rudy** **brown** **hugh** **.** **light** **tan** **two** **finger** **rocky** **head** **,** **belgian** **lace** **abounds** **and** **a** **light** **tan** **ring** **hangs** around . very fruity malty aroma , with some rounded out vanilla and hoppy citrus notes . a very smooth flavor , robust malts , caramelly malts , and juicy fruity , citrusy hops . the oak does not present itself in flavor , so much as in smoothness , and thats nice . very full , but sweetish mouthfeel . this is a nice take on arrogant bastard , i think the oak does a nice thing for this beer . very round , a tasty .
**pours** **an** **orange** **copper** **color** **with** **a** **moderate** **sized** **off-white** **head** **that** **fades** **into** **a** **sticky** **lace** . nose is floral and spicy hops with a touch of fruity citrus . medium in body with a somewhat slick texture . taste starts off with a bit of biscuity malt sweetness but is soon overpowered by bitter raw hop oils and resins with some notes of acidic grapefruit rind . it 's an unbalanced beer , but i think that 's the intention here . it 's certainly a beer i enjoyed and would recommend to any hop lovers . thanks to loki for the sample
**this** to me is one **of** **the** **worst** **beers** **of** **all** time . i grabbed this because it was on sale for 3 dollars ( that should have screamed to me that it was terrible ) and i poured it into a regular pint glass . the beer **poured** **a** **boring** **piss** **yellow** and the smell was just a tiny bit of something and water . the taste was not there , you get a little malt , but other than that not much at all . the mouthfeel is like highly carbonated water . i couldnt stand it so it went down the drain , as well as the other 5 . dont buy this beer , it is terrible .
22oz bottle **it** **pours** **a** **red** **tint** **with** **a** **nice** **little** **tuft** **of** **tan** **head** . i noted that it was very carbonated aroma of pine and citrus notes balanced with a sweet malt profile made this beer seem very promising . i noted that this beer does deliver the piney goodness of the hops and that it was indeed very rich with dark malts . i found that the hops shine through a little more than the malts and i did pick up some citrus in the taste as well , but i had to strain through the bitterness on the back of the palate . it flows over the mouth and tongue very well with just the right amount of carbonation . the after effects on the tongue downgraded it slightly . this is a very drinkable beer . i 'm picking some more up from bevmo on my next run , assuming they 're not all out .
nose is grainy/toasty , **mildly** **sour** **and** **hoppy** **.** **smells** **pretty** **good** **.** **pours** **clear** **pale** **gold** **,** **very** **mild** **head** **.** **looks** fair . flavor is indeed light . grainy toasty malt . spot of hops . slight sourness . very carbonated and thin bodied . tastes pretty good . feels okay . good drinkability . a decent light beer .
picked up from k & l wine merchants in redwood city , **ca** **.** **pours** **a** **pleasantly** **thick** **and** **pleasantly** **opaque** **black-brown** **colour** **,** just giving hints of copper-brown at the **edges** **.** **head** **is** **large-bubbled** **,** **but** **frothy** **and** **firm** **.** **lacing** is **excellent** **,** **leaving** **rivulets** **of** **foam** down the edge of the glass , much in the lager style . looks great . nose is equal parts smoky , sulphury and roasted . the sulphur character comes no doubt from the heavy fermentation with lager yeast , but it blends rather smoothly and pleasantly with the smoke and dark characters to give a complete picture . it does n't have the deep sweetness i might expect from a baltic porter , but it has depth nonetheless . very nice . taste is similar , with a big dose of smoke from the rauchmalz , which almost overpowers the rest of the characters . but , no , there are more subtle roasted characters , and even the hint of high-cocoa chocolate giving a vague sweetness , and a smoothness to the feel . indeed , the body is a little light and crisp , but this is perfectly to style , and the smoothness of flavour gives it a sheen to work around these things . this is certainly a smoky beer . in fact , the smoke is so dominant it almost makes it truly a smoked beer first , and a baltic porter ( a very distant ) second . i actually genuinely love the smoke character , but i appreciate the style on which it is based as well .
**a** **-** **pours** **one** **finger** **of** **sticky** **off-white** **head** . it has a **pretty** **good** **retention** **and** **leaves** **good** **lacing** . the beer is a slightly **hazy** **copper** **color** **.** s - lots of hops . a mix of piny and citrusy hops are most prominent in the aroma . m - a light-medium bodied beer with a slick feel from the hops oil . t - the biscuit like malts hit first followed by a nice does of citrus hops . some bitter hops round up the end leaving a nice finish . a slight fruity flavor lingers in the aftertaste as the bitterness dies down . a very delicious ipa it goes down easy and is pretty drinkable for it 's abv . this is my first offering from clipper city brewing , and i must say i 'm impressed . i 'm interested in seeing what else they have to offer .
**pours** **a** **nice** **clear** **golden** **brew** . smell is perfume and malt and grain . taste is perfume and sweet . mostly grain and malt flavor , tasty . i know that sounds simplified , but lagers can only be complex to a point . mouthfeel is good . very drinkable . did n't know that poland made good beer . i will buy this again .
bomber poured into my duvel tulip , not sure of the vintage as the bottle was undated , the name of the beer was stenciled on the label rather than hand written ( maybe that helps ) . **appearance** **:** **amber** **in** **color** **,** **little** **to** **no** head even after a “hard-pour” , **what** **little** **head** **there** **was** **quickly** **recedes** **to** **a** **thin** **ring** . smell : sweetness on the nose , maybe some spice ; however , it is the honey like sweetness that is dominant . taste : again , this is a sweet beer and unlike most tripels it remains sweet with very little bitterness on the finish . this has a honey-like flavor mostly . the hops manage to introduce enough balance to keep the beer from becoming cloying . this is an enjoyable beer ( especially if you like a sweeter beer ) but it really would be an odd fit for the tripel style . you do get hints of spice ( and maybe some citrus notes ) as you continue drinking mouthfeel : there is enough carbonation to keep the beer from becoming syrupy and that adds to the overall enjoyment . overall : different for a triple , not bad , but not great . an above average beer for sure . i’d definitely try it again if they had it on tap when i was in for a visit . abv is well masked .
**pours** **slightly** **thick** **with** **no** **real** **head** **.** **very** **hazy** **carmel** **color** **.** smells creamy and hoppy smooth , but slightly heavy medium body . creamy with a nice hoppy flavor that gets stronger the deeper you get into the taste . there is a slight sweetness in the aftertaste . hops are there for sure but not overwhelming .
from notes . tasted on draft at sheffield’s **.** **pours** **oily** **black** **with** **a** **thin** **brown** **lace** **head** . aromas are vanilla , bourbon , caramel , milk chocolate , molasses , and a hint of smoke . it also leaves a spicy tingle on the nostrils . the beer starts off sweet with bourbon , caramel , molasses , vanilla , and moves to some bitterness . the chiles really kick in on the back of the palate with a delayed and slow , spicy burn . the body is huge with light carbonation and a super long , slightly bitter finish that left me with a spicy burning sensation for almost thirty minutes afterward .
**i** **took** **a** gamble on a case of this hsa ( as a 2002-2003 the store had it in the discounted out-of-date section ) . it **poured** **a** **clear** **dark** **orangy** **gold** **with** **a** **minimal** **head** . the initial aroma was of sharp spices and maple malts . there 's also a touch bitter of hops back there somewhere as well . the mouthfeel is luscious -- a medium thickness offset by modest carbonation . the taste is reasonably well balanced ; there a syrupy cherry and pear sweetness at the start , but it fades quickly as the hops kick in , and the finish is rather tart . the alcohol is more evident in the taste than i expected for a 7 % brew ; i think it 's more potent than reported .
**appearance** : split a bomber at poppy 's pizza in estas park , colorado after a fantastic meal . i 'm not generally a huge fan of moylan 's labels , but i really liked the brown label on the old blarney . it seemed to fit the style and the beer itself very well . more importantly , though , once it left the bottle , the old blarney poured **a** **deep** **,** **copper-red** **with** **a** **thick** **,** **foamy** **and** **off-white** **head** **.** **good** looking . smell : dynamite smell with some strong chocolate flavors and a some sweet malty notes as well . taste : quite hoppy for a barleywine with as much malt as i smelled in it , which is a good thing . again , there was plenty of chocolate present along with some sweet notes , but it finished much more dry than most barleywines i 've had . mouthfeel : silky and smooth on the way down , this had a nice , warming mouthcoating feel overall : after debating between two barleywines for dessert i am very happy we went this direction . it was an excellent choice to finish off a fantastic meal .
**poured** from a bottle into a tulip a - **pours** **a** **slightly** **hazy** **golden** **color** **,** **nice** **one** **finger** **white** **head** **that** **retains** **well** **,** **decent** **lacing** s - hoppy citrus with pine notes , slightly yeasty t - definite hop flavors , pine , bitter citrus , there seems to be some sweet caramel notes mixed in m - medium body , good balance of carbonation , silky smooth d - solid double ipa , a nice one to sip on during a summer night
**poured** **a** **deep** **reddish** **brown** **with** **a** **huge** **fine** **textured** **light** **tan** **head** **.** excellent , enticing aroma of dark fruit , figs perhaps . very fine carbonation with a lush , silky mouthfeel . i did n't find this brew to be overly sweet , there 's a hint of sweetness but it 's not overwhelming . notes of figs , toffee linger on the palate - smoothly balanced with a muted spiciness . an very enjoyable beer .
**this** **beer** **pours** **a** **fairly** **cloudy** **mahogany** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **bubbly** **little** **head** **that** **retains** **a** **bit** **and** **laces** . the aroma is liqueur like with lots of abv presence , lots of biting hops , some raisiny notes , maybe some clove . the smell is quite pungent and a pretty good indication of what is to come . the beer is strong , and does n't hide its alcohol presence all that much . there is a good balance between some bittering hops and sweet malts . there are florals in this beer , some heavy fruit presence , and maybe some orange . this beer is just too strong for its own good . the consistency is quite full bodied , a bit syrupy in consistency , slightly carbonated , and did i mention strong . there is a slight throaty burn to this beer because of its abv . if this were toned down a few notches , it would be more enticing for my tastes .
**pours** **a** **slightly** **hazy** **amber-gold** **,** not particularly bright , **but** **the** **head** **is** **an** **excellent** **fine-bubbled** **frothy** **head** **.** **lacing** is truly excellent . truly an **excellent** looking brew . lots of american hoppiness on the nose , lots of luscious fruit , citrus and a bit of pine or pepper . there 's a vaguely undermining diacetyl character , but not huge , but it is really quite reminiscent of a west coast us ipa . very nice . taste is also pretty true to style . an initial pepper/fruit/sweet hybridisation , which wells through a light acidic note before descending to a raw and very robust bitterness . quite a high level of bitterness - i have to say it 's one of the few beers i 've yet had from outside the us that has the balls to bitter hop so heavily . something for the danish hopheads , and those of us outside who are lucky enough to get a hold of it . mouthfeel is a big and sparkling adventure . big , bold and exciting - it does n't quite have the freshness , and the balanced complexity of hop characters as some of my favourite american examples , but this is certainly one to savour and rejoice that we can get here in australia
i drank this from a 22oz bottle into a **rochefort** **chalice** **.** **the** **beer** **pours** **a** **dark** **orange** with a **hint** **of** **amber** **.** **the** **head** **is** **light** **white** **with** **light** **retention** **and** **lacing** . the aroma is matly not a sweet citrus , just sugar malts with a hint of alcohol . the taste is very watery with just a little bitter . this is very boring .

**poured** from a 750ml into an oversized **wine** glass **.** **nice** **,** **dark** **cola** **colored** **body** **,** with **a** **cookie** **dough** **head** **.** **really** **thick** **lacing** . nose was of apple jelly and a bit of alcohol brew was nice and creamy , with flavors such as apple , sweet breads , and alcohol . this was tasty , but a bit too sweet for me to have too much of .
**a-** **light** **amber** **color** **to** the beer , it had been stored on lay-a-way for a while before i got a hold of it , so it might not be the best example **.** **nice** **lacing** , **but** **it** **dissipated** **quickly** **s-** has a sweet tinge to it , typical of an ale t- tastes like a normal ale , but a little lackluster compared to others , still better than a generic ale you might find , however this brewery produces better beers m- lots of carbonation d- this beer is definitely designed to be consumed in large quantities , which is a good thing , its not too filling and the taste stays crisp .
**this** **is** **a** **pretty** **decent** **oatmeal** **stout** **,** especially for the price . we start this review off with **a** **nice** **dark** **chocolate** aroma . there is also a whiff of sweetness . i am also getting some espresso notes in the nose as **well** **.** **the** **head** **retention** was **medium** **.** **the** **head** itself **was** **creamy** **,** **quickly** **dissipating** **into** **thick** **lacing** **color** **is** **a** **dark** **brown** . this beer is thin for a stout.. you can see through the glass if held up to the light as far as taste goes , you will find bakers chocolate , toast and oatmeal . there is a sweetness that is quickly drowned in a bitter malt aftertaste . very enjoyable .
**poured** **a** **nice** **brown** **with** **a** **beige** **head** **.** **some** **head** **retention** . and a bit **of** **sticky** **lacing** . smell- dark fruits , malts a bit of hops taste- sweet toasted malts up front , dark fruits and a bit of a hoppy finish . really tasty brown mf- medium body and carbonation . a nice brown . i do n't love brown ales , but this is a pretty nice offering .

presentation : poured into a **duvel** tulip **after** **a** **very** **foamy** episode from the bottle and glass . it just would n't settle down . a : poured out **a** **hazy** **,** **dark** **amber** **with** **a** **thick** **4** **finger** **head** **.** **heavy** **lacing** . s : grapefruit and earthy tones , almost like a mild manure ( sorry ) with a typical belgian yeast smell underneath it all . t & m : nicely balanced with a bready taste . hops are there with an ultra-dry finish . citrus and herbal hops come through with a mild malty sweetness . a little too heavy on the carbonation though . medium bodied . one is enough for me . not that i would turn down another , but i 'll stick with the standard ipa 's and dipa 's .
**a** - poured into **a** **tulip** **glass** **.** **pours** **cola** **dark** **brown** **with** **chocolate** **highlights** **and** **a** **khaki** **head** **.** s - burnt coffee , bittersweet chocolate . syrupy smoky resin . t - earthy , with a sweet almost tart chocolate flavor . little bit of smokiness in there too . m - velvety , smooth .

**oh** **mama** ... **mama** i 'm comin ' home ... yo mama did **n't** raise **no** **ugly** **beers** ... too many euphemisms to apply to this one . i received a super fresh growler of the masala mama courtesy of a trade with tavernjef , and i am certainly glad to have tried it , and given that i 'm most of the way through the growler , i must have liked it ... ok enough banter , on to the beer . mama poured herself into my glass **a** scintillating **orange** copper/color **piled** **high** **with** **two** **fat** **fingers** **of** **persistent** **off** **white** **foam** ... and we 're **not** **talking** lacing here , we 're talking full **length** **curtains** . aroma is dripping with fresh hops , i picture myself wading through a fresh mown field on the verge of an evergreen forest ... was that pine sap i just felt dripping on my shoulder ? taste is a stealthy assault of bitterness at first before blossoming into true hop glory , with myriad flavors of grapefruit , pine , and green grass . all that hop flavor is packed in without being overpowering or astringent . after getting over the hop blitzkrieg imparted in the first wave , a good sweet maltiness becomes apparent with just a hint of biscuit/victory malt flavor . finish brings back the bitterness and stays with you as a silent reminder that mama 's always watching . body is medium to a bit thick for an ipa but the mouthfeel is smooth enough to make you cry for mama . flavors and complexity build as the mama warms a bit , bringing out orchard peaches and other fruity esters . this stuff would be great on a hot summer day or , well any other time you can get it ... .damn good stuff .
**(** **would** **the** **unbroken** **streak** of **sublime** **liquids** from packages featuring images of **smiling** **monks** **with** **vessles** **of** **frothy** **liquid** **held** aloft be continued ? i 'm thinking of st . bernardus products and dr . loosen erdener praelat rieslings . ) **mute** , **orange** and caramel aromatics occur beneath adequately **fizzy** , orange-colored liquid . on the palate it is a bit wild , dry and aggressive , with metallic , electric orange peel and over-fermented bread flavors . gassy , with robot-fart metal belches replete with ripped , stripped sugars and hot grease nuances . thin where it counts , hot where it should n't be , this is a careless , industrial 'craft ' beer . aggressively alcoholic and lacking texture . a shame . not worthy of the description 'tripel . '

**beer** **drinkers** **distinguished** by candor and insight **boast** in their inborn belief in the superiority of samuel smith beers . this lager is a harbinger of success . it is **teeming** with life . it is unreservedly , unequivocally , and **absolutely** right , and i feel called upon to asseverate that samuel smith 's brewed lager beer will flow in a notable way amidst the mountains of god . i would say so in the presence of an apostle .
thanks to whaleman for breaking open this bottle **...** **appears** **black** **with** **a** **small** **tan** **head** **and** **scattered** **lacing** . smell is of pine hops , caramel , bitter and creamy chocolate notes . taste is of the same aromas with plenty of bitter and hop filled flavors . mouthfeel is crisp , bitter , rich , and full bodied . drinkability ... hops need to settle a bit . not as warming as i had hoped .
**this** the seasonal offering by long valley **pub** ; it is listed as a strong english ale that is 'intensely hopped ' and does not use spices . from the tap it is poured into a pint glass **:** **a** **nice** **medium** **amber** **with** **a** **brownish** **tinge** . it has **a** **lingering** **thick** **head** **and** **substantial** **lacing** that hangs on the glass . the aroma is strongly hopped and definitely has more notes of american hops than english style strong ale . there is some bread and toast aroma beneath the grapefruit like hops . i personally would have preferred more depth and balance . the flavor follows this and is hoppy upfront ; there is a caramel and sweet toastiness but it does n't seem as well balanced . the flavor overall seems a bit thin for a beer that ranks in between 6.5-7 percent according do the bartender . it is certainly not a bad flavor , but also nothing that i thought was exceptional . the mouthfeel is good and has some body which helps lend more smoothness . in fact i think the mouthfeel is one of the stronger points of this particular beer . i found it to be very drinkable , just not particularly memorable .
**clean** **eggshell** **white** **that** **drops** a full peg although its imprints remain stitched into the glass . **processions** of bubbles parade top to bottom . a lusterless **cider** **complexion** . it looks about as standard a macro lager as there is the smell is trademark macro lager stink : corn , chemicals , and stale water . my nose can detect some malted grain that is spoiled by the aforementioned . the fact that i can still manage to extract some sense of straw says a little something ; at least it is not completely ridden with corn the taste is ripe with sweet yellow corn with a quenching finish of straw malt . a flavour saturated with damp grains give it some weight on the palate , the 'damp ' far more responsible than the grain bill . it is a little watery , which is better than adjunct-y . the aftertaste and unpleasantness is minimal , although a complete absence of bitterness allows a lot of sweetness to go unwelcomely unchecked i 've seen these green bottles in open six packs as far west as california and as far east as poland . i 've never had an issue with it , but i 'd advise a change because 'canada 's oldest independent brewery ' does in fact offer a lager a little cleaner drinking than its now foreign owned counterparts . drink it cold , and expect what is to be expected .
**are** **n't** i the luckiest fella ? another night at work , another confiscated can for some **cheap** **bastard** ... .and this time it **'s** **gluek** **golden** **light** **transparent** **and** **minimally** **yellow** **...** **no** **head** ... sweet syrupy nose ... unappealing ... .empty . taste : none . no flavor , no feeling , no nothing . zilch , zero , nada . whoever buys this has been bamboozled , no doubt about it utterly pointless . for suckers only . you 're going down the drain , buddy . i did this for you , fellas , do n't let my efforts be in vain .
**a-dark** **brown** **with** **a** **nice** **tan** **head** **that** **sticks** around for a while . s-smells a lot like boston lager . nothing else really here nice chocolate taste . like a boston lager with a little bit of chocolate added to it m-medium body and smooth d-very drinkable and nice
on tap down the street **from** **the** **brewery** **dark** **garnet** **with** **two-finger** **tan** **head** **.** dark munich malty aroma ; very clear . solid hop bitterness ( though little to no hop flavor or aroma ) lightly carbonated . a solid example of the style and a great-tasting session brew ( just over 4 % ) . glad i got the chance to taste it over there : i doubt eggenberg 's ( this one , at least ) distribution is very wide
sampled at the 2003 maine brewers ' fest **.** **retro** **porter** **'** **produced** **a** **nice** **foamy** **head** but it was bashful -- after a few minutes , **where** **the** head lingered and grew turned into a dark dialated pupil with an **iris** **of** **what** **remained** **of** **the** **foamy** **head** . the flavor came on with a rather earthy character- reminding me of the 'black gold ' of the forest floor and conjuring images of the dark wild woods . in fact , i 'd use this flavor note to characterize this porter . after the initial earthy notes pass , a hops bitterness remains ; subtle malt hints continued on my palate to taper down to a long lasting flavor and a clean finish . hints of toasted malt way down on the finish profile lingered.. in conclusion , primarily an interesting porter because of the earthy like flavor start . i 'd like a little more flavor body with a heavier mouthfeel , but as it is , it 's perfectly permissible for a porter .
from a 2007 ceramic bottle the was 750 ml in size this **poured** **a** **very** **deep** **and** **slightly** **hazy** **copper** **garnet** **color** **with** **a** **very** **thick** **and** **long** **last** **tan** **hear** **that** **left** **great** **lacing** . nose of floral and citrus hops , and sweet malts . mouthfeel thick and oily . flavor is sweet and slightly bitter , and you sure notice the alcohol.burn . bitter finish . however the 11.5 % alcohol starts to numb the tongue near the finish . this probably could have used another year on the shelf . served at cellar temperature - 55 degrees .
**great** for the price . no complaints there this **is** **a** **light** **clear** **straw** **color** **with** **a** **thin** **head** . as for the smell , it is similar to the typical adjunct lager . lightly hoppy , but pretty watered down . there is n't much to it . the taste is grainy and bready . the bready is n't like a belgian , but almost stale tasting . i do n't mean this in a negative way , but just as a means of distinguishing the two . it is n't as watered down as i expected . not too bad for the price this is an easy drinker . i enjoyed it . i would n't classify it with the best of the best , but for what it is it is pretty decent .
**a** **great** **big** **3** **finger** **tan** **head** **with** **uniform** **small** **bubbles** on the **poor** **with** **good** **retention** . dark brown with many medium **sized** **carbonation** **bubbles** **.** **minimal** **lacing** smell is of a small banana at first but nice malt and a little bit of roast like sausage meat . slightly dry and bread like toast as well but hard to detect . even some faint milk chocolate after quaffing . great smelling beer lots going on here . great mouthfeel and a nice sweet banana at first with mild carbonation , turning into a good simple brown bread . light milkshake wet/viscosity feel and some light faint milk chocolate as well . this is a great finishing drink and a fantastic tasting beer . i 'd have another in a heartbeat .
**copper** **brown** **in** **color** **with** **a** **fair** **but** **fast** **fading** **head** . a good bit of malt in the aroma , toasted barley more than sweet caramel , not mush hop smell . flavor is same as the aroma , toasty malt with light hop balance . medium smooth mouthfeel with a clean finish . a nice brown with good drinkability , nice example of the style , just not one of my favorite styles .
**i** **'ve** **always** **heard** **of** the **quality** of **canadian** beer , especially when i was a kid , so when i saw that a local store began carrying a variety of widely available brews , i decided to pick this up , knowing full well of the more than recent **molson** **coors** merger as of late . poured into a glass from a standard 12 oz . bottle ; the medium hardness **pour** **produced** **less** **than** **1/4** **'** **head** **,** **which** **quickly** dissipated . when brought up against the light , this beer shines through with gold . when i put my nose deep in the glass , i smelled little scent at all . light ' nose taste does n't even put it . this is the chiefest disappointment of this brew , seeing as other characteristics of it are quite good . the taste is quite good for a light , n . american brew that is in wide distribution . however , amongst hoppy ales , others take the cake when compared to molson 's golden . a better brew which mimics this style would be founder 's dry hopped , an immensly hoppy , especially fantastic american craft . all in all , i could drink a couple of these , however , i probably wo n't pick up another case of these , unless i am looking for something in the price range and no other suitable alternatives exist .
**pours** **a** **nice** **deep** **copper/amber** **color** **,** **with** **a** **fluffy** **,** **irregular** **head** . aroma is resionus , **almost** **piney** **.** **lacing** on this is great . taste is rip-roaring hops . i kind of like it , as it 's not the common grapefruity laden hops of most american ipas . it 's slightly different , like i said in aroma , piney . there 's also a touch of sweet malt on the foretaste to balance it , but this one is hop driven . mouthfeel is full , nice . nicely carbonated , without being overcarbonated .
**poured** from a bottle with no freshness date . **the** **color** **is** **a** **cloudy** **yellow-orange** . there is a good amount of carbonation , giving it a sparkly , fizzy mouthfeel . because it was poured slowly , there was **no** head and therefore , **no** lacing to speak of the aroma is faint , but , i detect some butter and tangy orange along with peaches and other fruits the taste is lemony with a light body . the hops are very light and there is little malt .
12 oz . bottle poured into a pint glass . **beer** **is** **black** **with** **a** **dark** **mocha** **head** . very **appealing** smells of roasted malts , coffee , and lots of chocolate . plenty of hops for an ris . taste is more of the same . i find it leaning more towards chocolate than anything else . hops can definitely be detected behind the malt backbone . the mouthfeel is thick and a bit rough around the edges , which i do n't mind . drinkability is pretty good since i much prefer a thicker ris . i find thinner versions are actually more difficult to drink in any quantity . all around a very good beer .
**poured** **a** **light** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **thin** **white** **head** **,** **little** **retention** **or** **lacing** . smells like raspberry cool aid . taste has a light malt profile with a strong bit of raspberry flavoring , not overpoweringly sweet , but very artificial tasting . no hop flavors to speak of . mouthfeel is light and oily . ok , but not something i will be looking for again .
**a** **good** **example** **of** **a** **belgian-style** **white** **beer** **.** **hazy** **,** **thin** **golden** **with** **little** **head** and **few** **visible** **bubbles** , but a definite effervescence in the mouthfeel . aroma is typical of the style , wheaty with coriander notes . flavours are also typical of the witbier style , but this is a sweet and well balanced example . there are fruit tones in the palate that i do n't pick up in the aroma . not personally my favourite type of beer , but i believe this is very true to style and would compare well against anything in belgium .
**this** **beer** **has** **a** **golden** **appearance** **with** **a** **nice** **white** **head** **.** **looks** **like** **every** **other** **pale** ale out there , but somewhat above average . nothing else really sets it apart as far as looks went . smell was nice - piney and that 's about all i could get but that is n't a bad thing . rather pleasant and above average . taste was very clean and had a piney hopped finish . really ca n't ask for more from an apa except for something distinctive to set it apart from the rest of them . well executed though . mouthfeel was crisp and clear . no aftertaste . drinkability was excellent . if it was n't so hard to acquire , i 'd definitely drink a lot more of this brew . either that or make more trips down to the grand canyon as i had this on tap at the el tovar cocktail room . it 's well worth drinking , especially if you can find it and enjoy a simple but well-done apa .
thanks to dave for this bottle . out of my founder 's **tulip** **.** **a-** **pours** **a** **glowing** **reddish** **amber** **,** **clear** and crisp . the beer pours **with** **a** **healthy** **white** **head** **,** **and** **the** **lacing** is pretty **intense** s- smells sweet and fruity , the papaya is very evident . some fruity and piney hops are present too t- it 's smooth and slightly sweet . the finish is dry and hoppy , with a touch of papaya . excellent dry hoppy aftertaste . m- very good here as well . it has enough body without being too overboard . there is n't a whole lot of carbonation , but that 's ok o- this is pretty tasty , could use a bit more papaya though . i 'm not sure you would know it was there if it was n't on the bottle . a big malty single ipa that is quite tasty .
**a** **wow** **beer** **for** me . i 'm not a big 'fruited ' beer person , i believe this is packed with **cherries** and or other things though this was debated at hamiltons **.** **amazing** **red** **and** **pink** **color** **,** **some** **froth** , and sparkle to it . intriguing how it hit the palate , sizzles , then **poof** dissapears , then a drawn out mineral , sour and balanced finished . the back of a bottle notes the beer can be enjoyable for 20+ years ? i 'd love to try a 1988 bottle ! luckly found some and will be aging them . a real treat .
12 ounce bottle poured into a **duvel** **tulip** **.** **see-thru** **brownish** **amber** **body** **.** **decent** **splotchy** **lacing** **left** **by** **the** **cream-colored** **head** . nice malty nose- sweet , toasty and nutty , with hints of molasses . those elements are joined in the mouth by some overripe apple and a touch of leafy bitterness . a bit of what seems to be oxidation , but not enough to significantly detract from the experience . not a bad little brown ale here .
33cl bottle with a bbd of july '11 **.** **pours** **a** **hazy** **dark** **caramel** **color** **with** **a** **small** **light** **tan** **head** **that** **disappears** **quickly** . loads of sediment , despite the careful pour . smells heavily sweet and fruity , with notes of orange and cherry . a bit of brown sugar and some chocolate , as well as alcohol . tastes of dark fruits and dark caramel malts . very yeasty , giving it a nice tang . much dryer than one would think going in . warming alcohol finish . light-medium body with heavy carbonation . pretty pleasant .
**pours** **out** **in** **a** **opaque** **dark** **yellow** **colour** **,** **topped** **with** **a** **large** **,** **thick** **white** **foam** . very cotton-like but fruity and strong aroma of of oranges , peaches and banana with undertones of coriander . it also has some weak vinous accents thick and wheaty flavour of cloves , banana , apricots and oranges . thick , full and round mouthfeel . quite tart in the back of the throat bananas in the long velvetly soft finish with hoppy note from orange-peels . a wonderfull winter wheat , too bad it was only 5000 bottles made
served into **a** **small** **tulip** glass and shared from a 750 ml . a firm **pour** **yields** **one** **finger** **of** **bubbly** **off** **white** **foam** **atop** **a** **light** **brown** **body** **,** **clear** **and** **crimson** in the light . offers **some** **artsy** **lacing** after settling to a light film . tart cherry and some and light plum on the nose after a light hop presence **dissipates** with **the** foam . some vinous grape notes initially , though lessening with air and exposing a bit of light wood and spice . black currant adds some depth , along with a subtle hint of vanilla and carob , then more dark cherry . nicely tart yet not really sour . mostly tart cherry in flavor and with a firm bite of carbonation that tingles the palate . a bit of smoke and wood appear briefly then a moderate fruit sense returns . just a bit rich in viscosity through the finish to truly grab my attention . carbonation holds up well over an hour yet drink is kept in check as the tartness numbs the palate somewhat , though paired with food this would surely not be a concern..
reviewed **nov** 2nd **2011** **a** **:** **barely** **hazy** **reddish** **orange** **,** **1.5** **finger** **head** **random** **rising** **carbonation** . s : piney hops , christmas spices , slight alcohol . t : quite bitter , piney , but not overly so , mediated by an earth savoryness , very hoppy . m : tart from bitterness , soft , sting , barely astringent . o : nice , like drinking a fresh forest .
**excellent** **looking** **beer** **.** **perfectly** **golden** **,** **cloudy** **and** **supporting** **a** **puffy** **cream-colored** **head** **with** **great** **retention** . bready aroma with classic belgian yeast smells . nothing overly complex . rich flavor , nearly no hopping as far as i can tell despite the name . maybe this is the english-style ipa rather than the american style . bready , a little banana . again , not complex but tasty . highly carbonated and it seems like it just keeps evolving co2 . definitely a sipper , and a meaty beer . classic belgian golden ale , well done .
transcribed from notes dated f , 30 july 2010 . this was presented to me directly off **of** **the** **handpump** **and** **the** **soapy** **head** **quickly** **fell** **away** **to** **wisps** . **color** was **a** **deep** **coppery-amber** **with** **ne-quality** **clarity** . nose had a caramel malt sweetness along with a slight spiciness , kind of peppery . mouthfeel was full , just less than creamy , with notes of caramel and black pepper on the tongue . the 'cheat sheet ' mentioned belgian dubbel and ipa yeast with chocolate malt as well as flake rye . i got a mild chocolate sweetness on the immediate finish , followed by a lingering rye spiciness . i began to sweat at that point , having been subjected to so much swill in cans . no wonder this beer has a following attributed to it - phenomenal btw , the most current issue of 'imbibe ' magazine had an article dedicated to the rye beer resurgence . it makes for a good read .
**pours** **to** **a** **clear** **straw** **golden** **,** **forming** **a** **small** **white** **head** **which** **recedes** **quickly** **but** **has** **good** **staying** **power** **,** **and** **the** **retention** is **minimal** . aroma is inoccuous generic american style brewpub pils ... little bit of hops , little bit of malt , touch of rice . mouthfeel is spritzy and very light . carbonation is moderate . taste ... i 'd swear this was a budweiser . same degree of carbonation , same rice taste , same bitterness level , same yeast character ... everything is the same . this is identical . clean finish . no perceptable alcohol . i 'd guess this is in the 3.5-4.5 % abv . no metals or other perceptable off-flavors . hard to believe this is an ale like the bottle says not half bad for a really light hot summer day cookout kinda beer , but i would n't pay anymore for this than budweiser . try it and see if you agree .
12oz bottle poured into a shaker pint **.** **a** **-** **amber** **color** **topped** **with** **one** **finger** **of** **soft** **off-white** **head** **.** s - bready malt , somewhat doughy , floral , spicy hop aroma . t - more bitter than indicated by the smell . nice malt backbone with a rather dry , cracker-like flavor . citrusy hop flavor reminiscent of orange zest . assertive bitterness that gradually fades into a balanced finish . m - medium body , somewhat coarse on the palate . d - a decent pale ale , but not one of the more exciting of the style .
**a-** **orange** **tinge** with exceptional carbonation t- very well balanced and hopped with a nice citrus perhaps even tropical appeal to the flavor . the hop flavor is floral at the end and doesnt linger or coat the palate excessivly s- sweet and citus notes that are enticing and complement that flavor profile m- rounded and smooth followed by a slight bite that blends nicely overall an amazing ipa that isnt too strong , maybe a similar style with a little maltiness wwould be nice but i can appreciate this beer all around , i will be buying more tomorrow
**a** **very** **regular** **head** **fades** **into** **a** **thin** **collar** on a **very** **dark** **amber-red** **color** **body** . the smell shows a very round maltiness , some caramel , some dark fruits , sweetness , wood and notes of scotch . the taste is of a rich maltiness , showing dark chocolate and coffee with sweet notes of nuts , giving the brew a moccha like flavor . a warming but not overwhelming alcohol aspect appears at the time when hops usually get noticeable . the dark chocolate aspect persists and the finish is a bit sweeter than the body . the mouthfeel is excellent , very round and full , smooth , creamy , almost buttery . thick and chewy , with a low to medium carbonation . a very good beer .
**pours** **deep** **black** **with** **thich** **cream** **head** **,** **great** **retention** **and** **great** **lacing** . light scents with roasted malts and light hints of chocolate . maybe a hint an vanilla in there . light vanilla mixed with like roasted malts . light hints of coffee and cocoa . i even taste sweet bourbon . kind of sweet and candy like . very full bodied . kind of wet up front and dry in the finish a good porter overall . unlike many i try , there is not much dry charcoal and there is more sweetness . easy to drink .
**pours** **a** **deep** **reddish** **amber** **with** **a** **finger** **of** **off** **white** **head** **that** **slowly** **fades** **,** **leaving** **some** **nice** **lacing** . aroma is sweet caramel malts and some piney and grassy hops , but they 're not particularly fragrant like in an ipa or something like that . i also get some hints of dough , but the sweet malt is dominant . taste is loaded with sweet caramel offset nicely by the advertised 'hop bite . ' i also get some tea in the finish , but i think that could just be an effect of the hops . very full in body with moderate carbonation . smooth for an 8 % strong ale , the hops and malt are so nicely melded , i could easily drink a couple more of these .
**bud** **light** **&** **clamato** **chelada** has **a** **medium** **,** **pink** **head** **,** which **instantly** **fizzes** **away** and **an** **opaque** **red** **appearance** **,** **with** **golden** **splotches** left on the side of the glass . the aroma is of tomato juice and a slight whiff of clam broth . taste is of tomato juice , clam broth , lime flavor , and maybe some bud light . the body is medium to thick , and bud light chelada finishes soupy , like a watery clam chowder . overall , for what it is ( an odd concoction ) , it’s pretty enjoyable . i recommend it for someone who would like to try something different
**poured** out into a tulip glass . poured **dark** , with **a** **heavy** **looking** **,** **thick** **head** **,** **good** **lacing** . smell was sweet . a balenced malt nose , and a hint of a little spice . taste was much the same , a lot of flavor . a little too sweet for my taste , but i think this is a tasty beer . not one i would buy everyday , but i am glad i tried this one .
**cloudy** **brownish** **amber** glass with **an** **unmoving** **mass** **of** **a** **beige** **head** **.** **attractive** aroma of dark malts ( chocolate ) and the standard clove and banana weiss trait . plastic aromas are noted as well , likely a result of this bottle 's age . taste is akin to liquid chocolate-covered banana . slight carmel notes and pepper clove spice round this one out . plastic is noted once again smooth , soft and creamy in mouth . literally like pureed bananas . this must be a stunner when fresh . my bottle was impressive , even though clearly age-damaged .
**pours** **a** **slight** **tangerine** **orange** **and** **straw** **yellow** **.** **the** head is nice and **bubbly** **but** **fades** **very** **quickly** **with** **a** **little** **lacing** . smells like wheat and european hops , a little yeast in there too . there is some fruit in there too , but you have to take a good whiff to get it the taste is of wheat , a bit of malt , and a little fruit flavour in there too almost feels like drinking champagne , medium mouthful otherwise easy to drink , but not somethinf i 'd be trying every night
**pours** **an** **amberish** **golden** **color** **with** **a** **spritzy** **off** **white** **head** **that** **dissipates** **quickly** . alcohol very noticable in the nose . some lighter fruit notes and husky grain and yeast , too . initially sweeter , then moving towards a drier , alcohol-laden finish . alcohol burn at the end . pretty wine-like . the french government imposed a triple tax on beers ( belzebuth was the only french beer at ) 15 % and over , so the brewery revamped the recipe and rereleased it . ca n't say i could have these back-to-back , but a quality warmer anyhow .
**belgian** **dark** **ale** they say ? i am thinking not . fairly **dark** **in** **the** glass . **slight** **red** edges noticed when held to the light hints of toasted malts , slight burnt edges and ever slight roastiness . taste was pretty nice , more on the lines of a brown ale though , no belgian characteristics that i could find . pretty solid i would say .
serving notes : **hefe** glass , cellar temp aroma : **sweet** **floral** **hoppy** **aroma** . **appearance** **:** **almost** **no** **head** **but** **a** **thin** **persistent** **white** **film** **remains** . **orange-yellow** , slightly **cloudy** , but mostly clear . mouthfeel : light to medium body . extremely light carbonation that dances on the roof of your mouth . taste : floral hops across the tongue . smooth bitterness is almost refreshing . malty sweetness present but in a nice supporting role to the hops . drinkability : i could easily drink this ipa all night without tying my stomach in knots .
serving type : 500 ml bottle , no freshness date , poured into a tuecher **weizen** **glass** **appearance** **:** **pours** **a** **hazy** **dark** **yellow** **,** but still lighter than most **hefe-weizens** . **huge** **initial** head that tightened up to **a** **still-impressive** **half-inch** **of** **foam** . smell : not unpleasant , but not very assertive , either . lacks that banana bread flavor to which i have grown accustomed with hefeweizens and is reminiscent of a lager . taste : tastes more like an american wheat beer than a hefeweizen . malt flavor is not satisfyingly present . this beer has some of the spiciness typical of the style , but nothing to prop it up . is this the beer that austrian frat boys drink at their parties mouthfeel : lively , refreshing carbonation . thin consistency would wash food down well , but at $ 3.29 a bottle , i 'll stick to the high life for this function . drinkability : this is n't a terrible brew , but is n't really sufficient as a hefeweizen . it 's light and goes down easily , but there are considerably better hefe-weizens widely available i 've got to say , stiegl beers have never really done it for me . they tend to be too light-bodied and lack the complexity appropriate to their styles .
**clear** **,** **brassy** **reddish** **orange** **colour** **with** **a** **collar** **of** **white** **foam** **and** **a** **skim** of **fine** **bubbles** **covering** the surface of the beer . floral aroma , perfume , tangerines , vaguely spicy , crackers and oranges . nice flavour . bitterness fit well with the floral flavour and the citrus notes added some depth mid-palate . spices appeared towards the end , melding with lingering floral character . sweetness was more sugary than malty . medium to light bodied with average carbonation , decent texture . a very interesting beer that does n't sacrifice drinkability for uniqueness .
**appearance** **:** **1/2** **inch** **head** **,** **cloudy** **,** **orange** **brown** **in** **color** **,** moderate carbonation smell : bread , caramel , and dark fruit taste : bread , caramel , dark fruit , and a slightly hoppy ending mouthfeel : sweet start slightly bitter finish , light bodied , moderate carbonation drinkability : a decent above average winter warmer that is in the better half of those i have tasted this winter . i like the bready taste . i could have two or three .
**a** **-** **hazy** **golden** **brown** **/** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **dark** **tan** **airy** **head** s - citrus and piney hops t - sweet and spicy up front with a big hop punch as expected . hops are very piney . great lasting aftertaste m - great balance of carbonation and smoothness d - i 'm starting to like some of these highly hopped beers . i really enjoyed this one and can taste a lot of flavors under the hop punch .
**an** **amber** **pour** **with** **hints** **of** **pink** **and** **yellow** **.** **fluffly** **head** **,** **good** **lacing** . smells of high citrus ( gf , lemon ) and some leafy flower plants . hops are in there somewhere . taste has the hops ; nice crispness and flavor medium body and great mouthfeel , leaves clean with enough taste residue to want more .
**on** **the** **boat** with the **lads** in the summer when its light out til 930pm , this is your pick . its local ( ish ) , fruity ( ish ) , and hoppy ( enough to be refreshing without filling ) . had hundreds of these and the **marginal** **utility** is **always** **parabolic** . too sweet to have 14 of , but interesting enough to session all afternoon . find your groove with these and stay up late . a fine pair with any grilled veg .
**a** **-** **murky** **,** **semi-opaque** **honey** **.** **low** **head** . s -earthy . plantains , pineapple rind , apricot t - earthy hay and pepper . touch or orange . very saison-like . m - medium body . nice carbonation . balanced semi-dry finish . o - nice flavor profile .
**the** **pour** **a** **clear** **deep** **amber** **,** **the** head is **mediorce** **,** **the** **lace** **spare** **,** **the** **color** **off** **white** . nose is malt , citrus tones , light hints of bubble gum . front is malt , sweet , the top is medium , the finish is acerbic , dry , the 10 % abv , is felt in the 'tummy ' and the long lasting alcohol bitter aftertaste . works for me ! , as i like my beers pungent and brawny . ranks # 504 on my current 1000 beer master list .
**paulaner** **oktoberfest** **is** **much** **like** the description . it has **a** **thin-to-medium** **,** **off-white** **,** **root-beer-like** **head** **and** **a** **clear** **,** **copper** **appearance** **,** with a few **bubbles** **streaming** up **.** **some** **lacing** is **left** behind . the aroma is of sweet malts and slightly turned fruit ( from the alcohol taste is a combination of malt , sweetness , slightly turned fruit , a tinge of bitterness , and a touch of sourness . mouthfeel is light to medium , and paulaner oktoberfest finishes fairly crisp , clean , and refreshing . drinkability is medium . overall , this is a very good and interesting marzen beer , and i think you’ll like it
12.7 oz . numbered bottle vintage 2004 generously shared by todd hannon from his most awesome cellar for ba bottle share at the **beer** **mongers** **9.5.2010** **.** **light** **gold/straw** **colored** **body** **,** **no** **visible** **carbonation** **,** **minimal** **head** **and** **lacing** . dope funk nose , some characterized as vinegar , i got more of a fermented apple/peach juice aroma , no hops to speak of in the nose . taste is quintessential rodenbach , deep wood aromas , big brett presence , a bit of fruitiness , but overall huge funk , though no horseblanket or leather , overall very very smooth , more sour than tart . this is probably attributable to the unblended 'old ' lambic character of this beer . mouthfeel is medium-light , good effervescence , not sticky . i wish there was more of this to drink , in any case many thanks to todd for sharing this gem .
**this** **purple** **haze** **pours** **a** **nice** **light** **golden** **yellow** **.** **a** **fat** **head** gave **away** **to** **a** **thin** **lace** . the aroma is raspberries , nothing else . the aroma is not overpowering like most fruit beers . the taste is a touch of wheat with the raspberries and a bitter finish with hops . the raspberry flavor washed away to nothing after the swallow . it started out nice but ended up watery . i was hoping for a bit more fruit in the taste . the watery finish does n't make me want to drink more so it is low in drinkability . overall not bad , average or a bit above .
**let** me start by saying it 's exciting to see **beers** from mexico **which** **have** **color** **and** **substance** and flavor . in fact this is the first craft beer i 've ever had from mexico . poured **a** **meager** **1** **'** **head** **which** **quickly** **dissipated** **to** **lace** . dark in color **almost** like a stout and flavor likewise was similar to a mild stout but with a lighter body . smell and taste both had touch of sour almost like a drop of flemish sour . anyway , a big step up from forgettable weak mexican beers , but nowhere close to the craft beers from the states or from european classics . but keep up the good work cucapa .
**received** **this** in a recent trade with dnuggs as an extra . thanks doug i 've had a couple of wachusett **beers** in the past few years **so** **i** **was** looking forward to trying **this** **.** **a-** **great** **,** **clear** **bright** **orange/yellow** **with** **a** **1** **'** **head** **that** **stuck** around for a while . s- nice floral hops but not very strong . i can tell that this beer may be a little old , not too far gone , but not fresh . t- yeah , that confirms it . it tastes good , i imagine at one point is was very good but i am getting the thicker syrupy taste that happens to the ipa 's and dipa 's as they get a little older . fresh would have been good o- would like to try it fresh , it stills tastes good , but thicker and syrupy ... .hence why all ipa and dipa should have a freaking date on them
**time** for a re-review , as last review was done at a pub whilst on holidays in nz back in jan/feb **:** **dark** **brown** **in** **colour** **with** **low** **head** **that** **disappears** **quick** . **low** **bubbles** **and** **some** **hard** **lacing** a nice a complex mixture of dark chocolate , dark fruits , caramel and nicely roasted coffee palate is nicely bittered and full flavoured with fantastic texture . the flavours are heavy on the chocolate side , with some really intense roast flavours coming on through . really nice bitter chocolate aftertaste . good strong porter from a damn good producer . try also the whisky porter , same stuff just aged in barrel . do n't drink this bad boy too cold
**pours** **blacker** **than** **sin** and **twice** **as** **dark** **.** **huge** **tan** **head** **with** **lots** **of** **foam** and a few bubbles . smells like chocolate and roast with a some slight aromas of caramel . chocolate all over the palette and a bit of roast but nowhere near as much chocolate very creamy and effervescent . overall medium bodied .
**clear** **,** **pale** **amber** **hue** **,** **bone** **white** **head** **,** **smallish** **but** **staying** . aroma : soft , and slightly hoppy , mostly soapy . minor citrus , but any hoppy kick is muted , at best tasting it : nice hop attack on the palate , dry and brittle in the mouthfeel , before slowly fading back . returns with each sip . medium bodied , lingering hoppy finish gets juicier and brighter toward the end . enjoyable texture . nice taste . feels dry-hopped , and i imagined if it were n't , it would n't be quite so enjoyable . not bad , though , not bad at all .
bottle thanks to drgonzo3705 , thanks paul ! poured into a **regular** pint glass **this** **beer** **produced** **an** **amber/orange** **color** **with** **a** **very** **small** **head** **.** **it** **produced** **minimal** **lacing** . i could n't get much from the aroma other than hops and a ton of malt . i found that it was very easy to drink and before i knew it the glass was empty . if you want something complex and hoppy you should look elsewhere . as is , it is a good beer to just sit down and watch a game with .
**this** **beer** was poured into **a** **pilsner** glass from the 500ml bottle . **this** **beer** **pours** **a** **clear** **golden** **yellow** **with** **a** **decent** **white** **head** **that** **dissipates** to a **thin** **film** **without** **much** **lacing** . the smell is sweet and malty , crisp and clean . the taste is also malty up front but has enough hops to balance out the flavor there is a good mouthfeel , a little on the thick side for what it is but still quite good . overall a great beer to tailgate or cool down with in the summer .
**sparkling** **yellow** **hue** **with** **large** **marshmallow** **head** . light hops , corn , alcohol , grass in the nose . grass notes , bready , soapy hops in the finish . smooth but slick in mouthfeel . highly drinkable and enjoyable . sierra nevada is still the kings of hops even though this beer is a more average brew for them .
no date on the cork . **this** **ale** **pours** **a** **nice** **shade** **of** **brown** **.** **a** **very** **thick** **light** **tan** **head** was on top and never left . there is a yeasty , fruity aroma with a slight bit of roasted malt . the taste is nice , malt , raisins and tones of bread ( yeast ) mixed in . i enjoyed this beer more than the pale ale from corsendunk .a very smooth drinking dubble and easy to drink more than one . try this , you wont be disappointed .
**best** before19/05/11 . matured in oak barrels for 20 **months** **.** **pours** **a** **clear** **golden** **color** **with** **a** **fluffy** **1** **1/2** **finger** **white** **head** **.** slight sour fruit aroma in the nose along with a touch of oak . sour tart taste that transitions to sweet and then a slight bitter end . subtle aftertaste of alcohol . slight acidity to this one . light/medium mouthfeel . a little pricey at $ 4.39/33cl bottle but pretty satisfied with this one .
poured into a pint glass 3.5 a : depending on the lighting , **this** **is** **orange** **amber** **or** **amber** **brown** **in** **color** **.** **about** **one** **finger** **of** **frothy** **off-white** **head** **dies** **down** **quickly** **,** **but** **leaves** **a** **decent** **amount** **of** **lacing** . 3.5 s : pungent floral and citrus hops with emphasis on pineapple and grapefruit . not much going on malt-wise except for a touch of the standard crystal malt presence . still , reasonably pleasant . 3.0 t : moderate , or maybe more , hop bitterness . crystal malts with a very slight nuttiness . touch of citrusy hops . none of the flavors are very strong other than the bitterness and they do n't go together that well . 3.0 m : medium body . carbonation is a bit too high and is very bity , giving a not very smooth journey down . 3.0 d : this is n't a terrible brew , but it 's hard to figure out what is good about it .
**a** **:** **dark** **black** **,** **cream** **colored** **head** **.** **thin** **looking** s : smelled of roasted malts and chocolate a tiny bit t : nothing to write home about - it 's a dry stout , a little bitter , not that much malt , but it 's okay m : nice mouthfeel - smooth , dry , and well carbonated o : nowhere near their foreign extra stout , but it 's available . i 'm not a huge fan of the style , i 'd much rather have a russian imperial stout , but in the style this is drinkable but weak .
from a 12 oz . label says , ' we have combined the finest belgian malt , rare european hops , and an authentic belgian yeast and finally , the brew is dusted with tulip **petals** . **'** **gold** **to** **orange** **in** **color** **.** **chill** **haze** present . aroma is of pineapple and orange juice . little evidence of maltiness or cloves in araoma . first sip reveals sweetness with some hops bitterness . i do n't pick up much spiciness that would lend to more complexity . tastes like drinking pineapple juice with some bitterness . not very high in carbonation that i believe is desirable in this style . candi sugar is evident . beer reveals a little more after allowing to warm . still the sweetness seems to mask any spiciness .
**took** from the fridge and poured directly into **a** **clean** **glass** **.** **nice** **golden** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **little** **cloudiness** from the **sediment** **.** **average** **sized** **soft** **white** **head** **.** bright fruity smell of cherries and oranges . meduim/full body with medium carbonation . the taste was nothing special . very little alcohol taste present , though it did leave a warming feeling going down . taste was a little dry and malty with only a light hop taste on the finish . i really did n't care for this one very much .
**a** - **this** **one** **is** **a** **semi-transparent** **chestnut** **brown** **with** **a** **big** **fluffy** **three** **finer** **head** . there is a **reddish** **tint** to this brew , as if the smallest amount of rhubarb or **strawberry** color shines through . a decent **amount** **of** lace is left on the glass **,** **and** **head** **retention** is awesome . s - i can smell malty scotch notes wafting off this like on of speyside 's finest . up close , this is malty as all get out , with chocolate cake , scotch whisky , flaky pie crust , pound cake , almond puree , and a hint of something darkly fruity . raisins , but only just . there is also something there that is like an old guy 's cologne ... .musty , but distantly floral . like old dead flowers . t - mushrooms , earthy vegetation , sweet malty cake batter , and cashews . soy sauce and thai peanut sauce . oddly lacking in hoppage , but interesting and complex nonetheless . m - medium bodied with almost non-existent carbonation and a slick sugary mouthfeel . this is sort of bland in the mouth , but is redeemed a bit with the nice dry finish . d - too sweet and severely under-hopped . this is sort of a poor stab at a barley wine .
**basically** **this** is an **average** beer that would seem good at a party . that is because you can drink six of them and not be too drunk . i remember once having five of these and then having **a** **dog** **fish** **head** **90** **minute** . you can believe me when i say that it was a blow out . guess which beer one the tasting contest . it is pretty amusing if you think about it . this is fine for a frat party where the sole purpose is to get drunk .
**should** be kept in the can but **if** poured **,** **you** **'ll** **see** **a** **nice** **amber/orange** **color** . the can really masks the smell of sweet , sweet hops but you 'll get a whiff when you drink it . this doens't seem to be a very complicated pale ale but that does n't make it a less impressive brew . oskar blues defintiely does n't get the respect they deserve . this is a great beer . one of my top five pales . pack it in , pack it out
**first** **of** **a** **few** **great** divide brews i picked up **.** **pours** **a** **dark** **brown** **color** **with** **very** **little** **head** **.** **no** **lacing** down the sides . this is a malt centered beer and has the taste of some dark fruits , especially raisins but more so on the finish . subtle hop bitterness . a slight alcohol taste is well balanced for the style . overall this is an ok beer but not something ill be rushing back to the stores to pick up .
750ml corked and caged bottle poured into a tulip . ( a ) - **pours** **an** **almost** **crimson/ruby** **color** **with** **a** **nice** **tan** **frothy** **head** **.** **some** **lace** . ( s ) - great spices and a creamy pumpkin aroma with the slightest hint at some dry oaky vanilla . smells amazing ( t ) - not as awesome as the smell , but still very good . nice spice and pumpkin characters . the oak aging definitely added a nice dryness and an oakier , almost sherry-like finish to it that is quite nice . ( m ) - a nice carbonation level and balance . spicy , but with awesome creamy pumpkin and dry oak . ( d ) - a great pumpkin beer amidst some rather disappointing ones i have tried over the years . smooth , but tastes dynamic and very enjoyable . the oak aging really created some unique nuances in this .
**a** **clear** **,** **light** **molasses** **pour** **,** **almost** **amber** **** **topped** **by** **a** **thinnish** **lite** **brown** **head** **.** **died** **mighty** **fast** . a very sweet brew with maple syrup and molasses dominating the aromas and tastes . pretty darned thin and lightly carbonated ( not full bodied as the label states ) . this is an easy drinker to add to the summer fun , and would appeal to any crossover drinker candidates . to me , it needs a push to reach the status of scotch ale , but never-the-less , i enjoyed this lil brew . thanks to solomon420 for the desert treat .
**pours** **jet** **black** **,** **with** **a** **dark** **tan** **head** . in the aroma , big roasty malt and big coffee . in the taste , just like the smell , big roasty malt and coffee , yet coffee being quite smooth . a light bitterness and bg mouthfeel , with a semi dry roasty coffee aftertaste . nice big beer , big flavor and a nice smoothness .
**a** **-** **hazy** **peach** **.** **head** could be better - **sorta** **wimpy** looking - **like** **over-whipped** **egg** **whites** **-** **recedes** **quickly** to an everypresent cover . s - fruity and spicy . notes of orange , peach , mango and honey . some alcoholic smells . t - more big fruity flavours . fruity citrus - grapefruit and orange . bitterness finally shows in the aftertaste . very warming of course , at 9 % , but the alcohol is well hidden . balance is superb m - quite light and drying . d - very nice . not my favourite unibroue offering , but no complaints .
**this** **beer** **pours** **a** **pale** **golden** **color** **,** **has** **a** **two** **finger** **head** **with** **a** **fair** **amount** **of** **retention** **and** **some** **good** **sticky** **lacing** . the aroma is of pale malt with hints of grassy hops and it 's slightly grainy in the background . the taste is what you would expect from a pale ale it 's crisp , dry , and bitter . the piney hops stand out in the finish . the beer is medium bodied and highly carbonated but is very easy to drink . reflection : this is another good beer from the guys at hylands , if your ever in this area it 's definitely worth seeking out .
**tröegs** **java** **head** **stout** 12 oz brown bottle batch # 11001 ? ( **jet** **ink** is smudged ) served in my awesome smuttynose tulip glass **pours** **an** **opaque** **jet** **black** **.** **looks** **like** **ink** **.** **khaki** **colored** **trails** **and** **webs** **of** **sticky** **lace** . pleasant aroma with some roasted malt and sugary sweetness in the nose . dark roasted malts leading to flavors of espresso , hershey chocolate and sugary dairy . a well crafted , smooth and complex stout . the finish has a dark roast coffee and bitter hop flavor more nuances to the beer are revealed as it warms up to room temperature . the 7.5 % is very well hidden under the attack of so many flavors . an enjoyable stout this friday evening .
**a** **:** **pours** **a** **light** **golden** **with** **a** **nice** **white** **head** **with** **a** **little** **bit** **of** **lacing** . s : lots of sweet belgian malt and some nice yeast with a bit of spice . the oak adds a really nice touch . t : lots of spice and creaminess along with a bit of tartness . the oak adds a whole character of its own , and has me really enjoying this beer . m : medium bodied with generous carbonation . d : very nice ... another high quality brew from the folks in williamsport .
**slightly** **hazy** **amber** **in** **color** **.** **pours** **with** **half** **inch** **head** **good** **lacing** . nondescript smell . strong taste of citrus which lasts throughout . aftertaste is not bitter . average drinkability . slightly on the heavy side for the beer type . suprisingly high abc of eight percent
on tap at the belair location **pours** **a** **nice** **light** **amber** **with** **an** **off-white** **head** **that** **fades** , but not completely . smells of mildly citrusy hops , but not a strong aroma . not bad , just nothing to get me very excited . taste is just ok . some nice citrusy hop flavors up front , with an unexpectedly bitter bite in the aftertaste . hints of malt help make up some ground , but it 's just a little unbalanced solid body for the style . not a bad brew , and i could drink more than 1 if i 'm bellied up to the bar . but , there are much better apas to be had .
**poured** from a 12oz bottle into my nonic glass . it pours **a** **proper** **deep** **,** **very** **clear** **amber** **with** **a** **thick** **,** **rising** **,** **fluffy** **,** **pouty** **off-white** **head** that sits there for ages and only recedes to a thin but complete covering of the beer after a lot of sips **.** **lacing** is **phenominal** **,** **lots** **of** **sticky** **head** **bubbles** **clinging** to the glass that mark the beer 's progress . an extremely well-presented ale . smell a little bland ; a little sweet oaty malt smell . taste is a little hoppier than a lot of ales , but it 's a stone brew , and they do hops well . the front half of the tongue is tingled with caramel flavors that are quickly overcome with the acidity of the hops on the way down ; the bitterness hangs around a lot longer than i 'd like , which brings the taste numbers down . mouthfeel is pretty good , a lot of sparse , tight bubbles come together to fizz across the palate , leaving sticky , chewy reminders of the hops for a long time . nothing to write home about . drinkability gets a lower score because of the aftertaste ; it kind of becomes a chore just to finish one of these , much less to reach for another .
**church** brew works - quadzilla ( cherry **)** **a** **blend** **of** **white** **topped** **and** **silver** **topped** **bottles** . appearance : **appears** **a** **reddish** **amber** **in** **color** **,** **small** **fizzy** **head** **forms** **and** **retention** is low . smell : a not so good aroma on this one , smells alittle funky and not so much in a good way . as it warms the cherry comes into play and redeems it somewhat taste : belgian yeast , brown sugar and a complimentary cherry presence making this bottle conditioned ale quite a delight . nice depth of flavor , the whole range of cherry and belgian notes . mouthfeel is adequate , good carbonation on a light to medium body overall i thought this was quite good and worthy of revisiting somewhat often . i feel that the overall effect of this beer is greater than the sum of its parts , and was the best belgian style cherry beer ive encountered thus far . as other tasters have noted , this shares the style with troegs mad elf , but i give credit to the church brew works take on the style , as the alcohol was hidden alot more gracefully . good beer .
330ml bottle **pours** **with** **a** **dark** **burgandy** **body** **with** **ruby** **highlights** **,** the **colour** **thins** out quite a bit near the edges to a **thin** **diet** **coke** **hue** **.** **tight** **tan** **head** **with** **good** **retention** **,** **some** **patchy** **lacing** smell , chocolaty malt , bourbon biscuits , some dried fruit slightly in the background , little bit of coffee taste , smooth and crisp , chocolate biscuits and a whack of roasted bitterness on the finish tasty , worth the £1.25 i spent
glass at clark 's crossing **brewpub** **.** **nice** **,** **clear** **golden** **colour** **.** **thin** **white** **head** **struggles** to avoid an inevitable quick death . weak aroma is corn and grains and a little sweet . tastes more like a weak macro lager . grainy and a little sweet at the start . weak sweet corn aftertaste thin , watery body and moderately carbonated . everything i tried at this place has been watery . the other pubs in this chain atleast make drinkable if unexciting beers
**half** liter 2009 bottle split between two portsmouth snifters and shared with tulipsnifter . bought at beaumont market for $ 22 **a** **:** **dark** **murky** **amber** **with** **voluminous** **white** **head** **that** **diminishes** **to** **a** **wisp** **ring** **.** **no** **lacing** but none were expected . **great** **legs** s : nice smooth and mellow barrel character with minimal heat . no harshness at all with a lot of vanilla . the wood on this is pretty special t : again with the sweet vanilla and limited booze . peppery alcohol , butterscotch , toffee , and loads of other sweet bourbon characteristics come through on the palate . damn is this smooth m : moderate body with appropriate carbonation . sticky finish o : good stuff but not worth the price tag . it 's a solid four , but it you could score a half liter bottle for a better price it would be more appropriate
**a** : **it** **poured** **a** **clear** **orange** **to** **copper** **body** **with** **a** **modest** **white** **head** **.** there was **decent** **layered** **lacing** that lingered until the beer was gone s : it was dominated by sweet moderately toasted malts , honey and sweet ripe oranges . there was a hint of white yeasty bread t : it had a bold sweet malt flavor with a honey and caramel sweetness that covered hints of yeast and cirtusy hops . nice balance of flavors . m : it was smooth and light bodied with moderate carbonation and a sweet wet presence on the tongue . it finished wet and sweet . d : this is a pleasant pale ale . it 's modest abv and light body make it a good choice for a session beer .
**on-tap** at **the** brew kettle , strongsville , oh - 9/25/07 a : served in a 5 oz **.** **white** **wine** glass **.** **pours** **a** **mostly** **clear** **golden** **with** **a** **small** **bubbly** **head** **.** **little** **lacing** . s : slightly funky with a citrusy aroma . t : much like the smell . it 's got the characteristic lambic funk , but it seems subdued - apologetic almost . i was expecting more , and to be honest , quite disapointed . complimented by a lemon zest flavor . overall , the taste was light , subtle , and a bit watery . m : light in body with very light and smooth carbonation . again , slightly watery . d : not bad , and this may be a great beer to introduce the uninitiated , but it just does n't have the intensity that i 've come to expect from a belgian lambic or gueuze .
**pours** **a** **dark** **golden/straw** **color** **with** **a** **prolific** **amount** **of** **persistent** **bubbly** carbonation that **results** **in** **an** **off-white** **3-finger** **head** **that** **recedes** at a **slow** **pace** **and** **leaves** **no** **lacing** behind . swish it around a bit to open up the aromas . smells malty and buttery with some banana and orange fruitiness in the background . tastes malty up front with some very slight fruitiness and a bit of bitterness to round things out . mouth-feel is light to medium-bodied and very drinkable . anchor is very proud of this brew , and it does have the history to make them feel proud of it , but it does not compare to some of their other standards .
**very** **good** . **i** **love** a good ipa and this one was no exception . absolutely delicious . i like sierra nevada 's pale ale but to me this is much better . i wish it was available all year round . **appearance** **:** **copper** **colored** **with** **about** **a** **half** **inch** **head** . aroma : citrusy hops , lots of hops . taste : bitter/hoppy , citrus , a little malt . i highly recommend it and will definetely be buying more before the end of the season .
**i** was **n't** impressed at all by the bottled version of this , but after a week straight of upper 90s temperatures i thought it might deserve another evaluation . pours up **with** **a** **thick** **,** **clouded** **,** **banana** **peel** **color** **and** **an** **inch** **of** **creamy** **head** that falls to a small dusting of bubbles about halfway through . the cloudiness is about on par with a german hefeweizen after the yeast has been dumped . some lemongrass and ripened apple accent the bready , wheaty base . this one is definitely balanced away from the hop bitterness at 14 bus . clean , with a nice level of carbonation . the high percentage of wheat gives the perception of a hefty body . i do n't necessarily care for mustang 's approach to brewing , but it 's hard to deny that two or three of these go down pretty easy on a hot summer night .
**contract** **brewed** **by** **shipyard** **.** **fizzy** **sounding** **pour** **,** **decent** **head** **retention** **.** **filtered** **clarity** **of** **pale** **bronze** . mild butterscotch aroma , malty with a faint carbonic smell . a little watery on the palate ... this does not have the same fullness as it used to . creamy malt sweetness ... with a light hop presence . i like to put this beer and a diet cream soda to see how close they are .
on layover in **lima** **,** **peru** **heading** home from sao paulo to chicago ... for those that know ... .long story . i took the opportunity to try cusquena celebration **especial** whilst in **lima** **.** **a-3.5** **golden** **clear** **...** **rich** **looking** **thin** **head** **nice** carbonation s-2 smell is ok hints of grain t-3.5 very smooth and drinkable not overpowered by grain m-4 very smooth and easy drinking
**appearance** **:** **pours** **a** **slightly** **translucent** **dark** **brown** **color** **with** **a** **rather** **unimpressive** **head** that reveals the brown **liquid** **beneath** with **rapidity** smell : roasted malt and chocolate taste : chocolate , up front , with a developing roasty taste that adds some hop elements by mid-palate ; after the swallow , the chocolate comes back to the front ; the finish is dry and somewhat crisp mouthfeel : light to medium body with moderate carbonation ; rather thin for the style overall : a pleasant enough beer but the mouthfeel and flavor need to be bigger to get better marks from me
**a** **-** **deep** **dark** **almost** **black** **body** **.** **thick** **medium** **brown** **head** . s - the nose is huge chocolate . the chocolate aroma is intense , sweet , roasty and spicy . t - chocolate is foremost and it 's thick , rich , semi sweet chocolate . this is an imperial and the chocolate is almost in semi sweet chocolate syrup form . not many other flavors present except some toasty pumpernickel , warming alcohol and a bitter background . m - thick bodied , viscious and syruppy . its not overwhelming but you can really chew on this beer and it 's great . d - not highly drinkable by most standards , i could still take down a bomber bottle no problem . the flavors are ricvh and intense and its high abv but would consider it more of a savoring sipper . notes - if you 're into huge flavors and intense chocolate than you will love this one . southern tier is a great brewery and this one marks another fine creation .
**a** **:** **nice** **and** **dark** **,** **nice** **contracst** **with** **the** **the** **head** **before** **if** **fades** **to** **nice** **lacing** . s : i did not get a lot of pronounced smells perhaps it was a little to cold . t : very standard porter untill you get hit with the big vanilla finnish m : nice porter . d : this is a solid porter with a big finnish , a good change from the flavord beers that you have to guess at that the flavor . is it there or not . if you want a porter have a porter if you want a vanilla porter this is a good one .
drinking date : 12/18/10 expiration date : not listed glassware **:** **large** **mug** **appearance** **:** **deep** **brown** **in** **color** **;** **thick** **cream-colored** **head** **that** **retained** **fairly** well , thinned out about halfway through ; **a** **little** **lacing** . smell : like white bread . not a lot to go on in the aroma , but what was there did not remind me of other past beer smells . taste : immediate roasted malt taste , that drifts away as it passes through . not much happening after that . finishes as it began with a lingering roasted flavor . first taste of the beer is pretty good , but , as i drank , there were no surprises and no complexity to keep me interested mouthfeel : has a little more body whch makes it feel a little larger than your average lager . good bit of carbonation . drinkability : you could drink a few of these no problem , but the average taste and slightly heavier feel make it a less than good choice for steady drinking . notes : not a bad beer , but nothing special . i would try this again if i saw it on draft .
**like** **having** **a** **bowl** **of** **honey** **nut** **bunches** of malt for **breakfast** , this beer makes me as happy as a hurly-pearly squirrel going all hippidy hoppidy from tree to tree . the fat squirrel is actually pretty interesting especially when compared to **most** **brown** **ales** . its aromas and flavor are a perfectly balanced blend of honey , hazelnut , toast , walnut , and a tad smidgen of vanilla . the mouthfeel is light and smooth . not hoppy in the slightest . quite sweet . too damn drinkable for our own good .
**pours** **a** **dark** **rich** **burgundy** **amber** **tone** **with** **an** **off** **white** **head** . smell is sweet and biscuit with a strong sent of alcohol . taste reveals a coffee ground spice , very earthy . feel is well with not to much bite . not a bad beer , very english all around .
**a-dark** **transparent** **honey** **with** **a** **thin** **white** **head** **s-smells** like pine , grapefruit , and salty . good strength t-comes in with a good crisp taste of grapefruit . goes in to a decent taste of piney hops . the tastes are n't overly powerful but they 're nice and crisp . it has a nice after-taste of grapefruit m-creamy medium carbonation with a nice creamy finish o-its definitely an amazing ipa . it compares to the elder , though i think the elder happens to be slightly more robust , but only by a touch . its very well balanced , near perfect for an ipa .
**i** **like** **most** sa **products** **so** when i saw this i did n't hesitate to grab it . this beer **poured** **a** **very** **deep** **ruby** **color** **with** **a** **nice** **sized** **almost** **white** **head** **.** this brew **had** **excellent** **lacing** , more **like** **sheats** **of** **foam** on the glass . the smell was kind of hidden but i could sense a little maltiness and not much else . the taste was pretty crisp with a nice malt like taste . this brew was not as sweet as i thought it would , however a slight sweetness is detectable . the mouthfeel is very smooth and this brew was easy to drink . i think this might make a good session brew , i could probably drink it all night .
**best** **by** **07.29.15** **pours** **cloudy** **amber** **brown** **with** **a** **2** **finger** **head** **that** **faded** **fast** **an** **left** **no** **lacing** **smell** has lots of banana with lightly toasted malt spice from the yeast taste - still get some banana with kicks of booze but i pick up more dark fruit and caramel malt - plenty of spice from the yeast - not very sugary sweet which i like - nice and dry mouthfeel is light/medium with tons of carbonation whcih is very fitting for this style drinkability - i had this after a chimay red tonight and this was the hands down winner no contest
**pours** **very** **dark** **brown** **,** with **reddish** at the edges **,** **and** **a** **substantial** **tan-colored** **head** **that** **leaves** **good** **lacing** . smell is mostly citrus hops , and a bit weak . grapefruit is the dominant fruit , but i have to reach a bit to get it . taste is smooth rich malts , rather subdued , leading into a nice citrus hop punch , that finishes out without much lingering bitterness . the hops are the central character , but they 're backed up well by some malty richness and sweetness . looking at it , i was definitely expecting more roasted malt character than i got . medium-bodied , decent carbonation , not bad , but nothing special . this beer was a bit of a surprise for me . did n't know what to expect , but the dark color without a ton of malt flavor , and the strong citrus hop presence , are just right for a black ipa . quite tasty , better balanced than many beers like it , and one i 'm quite likely to drink again .
**in** **a** **tulip** **glass** **this** **beer** **was** **a** **dark** **amber** **color** **.** it had **a** **thick** **,** **off-white** **head** that was **very** **sticky** . a good deal **of** lace . aroma was mostly citrus and earthy hops . some sweet malt in the background . lots of fruit in the taste . grapefruit mostly , also orange and melon . tiny bit of piney hops . a little bread hoppy and warming . a nice try at a dipa .
**enjoyed** at the first annual summer saison tasting a huge thanks to **a** **most** **generous** beer trader - beerbeing . alex , **you** **are** **the** **man** **a** **very** **frothy** **head** **and** **intriguing** **appearance** . the top half of the body is glazed right over while the bottom half holds large **bouts** **of** **clarity** . the aroma imparts notes of spice and lemon as well as strong yeast and a slight sourness . it 's light , easy going and quite nice . a small part of the alcohol strength is detected in the mouthfeel ; it 's damp and thick bodied . a good balance between the malt and spices ( of which it 's not too heavy on ) . this is simple and my lasting impression is one that holds this being a very nice saison
**pours** **deep** **black** **with** **a** **thin** **,** **off** **color** **head** . the aroma is fair , woody and slightly roasted . the flavor is thinner than i expected , starting roasted and bitter , finishing bitter and woody , but largely lacking any flavor in between . it is , in fact dry , but i find it rather flat as well ( flavorwise , not in carbonation , which is adequate . the mouthfeel is awfully thin for a stout of any sort . ok , drinkable , but overall it feels more like some pallid offering from a macro brewer than something produced by a craft brewer .
**not** **much** **head** **here** . oh well , the **liquid** **is** **a** **very** **nice** gernet **hue** **butterscotch** and nutmeg and pac nw hops are what i smell out of the gate ooh ... not so butterscotchy tasting , but welcomingly sweet and dry at the finish with nutty roasting . not bitter . lemon , woody , piney
**let** 's pit the simcoe single hop versus the **nugget** , **warrior** , and **cascade** **versions** **.** **appearance** **:** **pours** **out** **cloudy** **,** **burnt** **orange** body with **a** **full** **inch** **of** **lasting** **,** **off-white** **foam** . smell : delicately toasted malts with notes of cookies and grains with a rich scent of sugar-flecked citrus wedges spritzed with pine . taste : lightly toasted base maltiness with a touch of dry caramel and crumbled cookies , though with only a light , restrained amount of sweetness . the simcoe hops serve up a fresh taste of citrus , particularly grapefruit , and a nice , spicy 'pop ' of white pine . moderate bitterness . finishes dry , crisp , and with some continued bitterness into the aftertaste . mouthfeel : medium-bodied . medium-plus carbonation . drinkability : i certainly enjoy the concept of a single hop series to really enjoy all the various vibrant nuances and characteristics of the particular hop varieties utilized . while this was previously done by bison , i had no love for the base beer used , so i quickly abandoned the idea of following that series . i 'm diggin ' this though
**this** **beer** **pours** **a** **cloudy** **brown** **color** **.** **the** head is **half** **an** **inch** **in** **height** **,** **and** **recedes** **slowly** into **a** **thin** **cap** **of** **foam** . the aroma is of caramel with a lot of butterscotch . i like a little diacetyl in a scotch ale , but this is way too much . it is n't an unpleasant , but it certainly covers up other nuances . the taste is like the aroma . the mouthfeel is medium-full bodied , with nice carbonation . overall , this is a scotch ale that i would rather not drink again .
bottle @ **home** **.** **dark** **brown** **appearance** **with** **a** **tan** **head** **that** **dissipates** **somewhat** **quickly** . dark chocolate , candy sugar , dark caramel , dark fruits , plum , raisin , belgian yeasty aroma . creamy , slightly thick mouth feel . dark caramel-chocolate , dark candy sugar , raisin , dark plum flavor . dark candy sugar , chocolate aftertaste . booze is hidden super well . my absolute favorite beer of all time .
**a** : poured from 12-oz . bottle into **tulip** glass **;** **dark** **,** **almost** **black** **body** **with** **thick** **2-cm** **mocha** **colored** **head** **that** **recedes** **1-cm** **leaving** **a** **nice** **lace** at edge . n : coffee & chocolate with a warming alcohol sent ... . almost reminiscent of amaretto . t/d : tastes of coffee with a heavy mixing of chocolate . the bitter & chocolate flavors compliment and play off each other as the flavors spread over the tongue . as expected , the alcohol remains subdued but becomes slightly more noticeable as the beer warms . decent amount of carbonation for a stout , but overall it is smooth and creamy . it looks more syrupy during the pour than it feels to taste , but it is unmistakably thick . a world-class imperial stout
poured into a sniffer glass from a 12 ounce **bottle** **pours** **a** **moderate-sized** **head** **.** **color** is a dark yellow/bronze **.** **smells** starkly bitter , almost to the tune of some very dry wines taste is almost like that of mead , with a definite honey presence . it 's taste is strong and very unique . i have n't had a beer quite like it . as it warms , the complexities become more apparent , which add to the flavor immensely . you have to give it to the sheer flavor of this beer , it 's very in your face , which is amazing if you like its style . however , i fear it may be too much for those who are on the fence about trying it for the first time my advise : if you 're into the extreme , this is definitely a beer for you . if you 're skiddish , i may suggest some easier brews .
**a** **-** **pours** **a** **hazy** **pale** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **fluffy** **one** **fingered** **white** **head** and active carbonation . s - coriander , wheat , lemons , and some earthy presence . t - grainy with lots of wheat , coriander , lemons , and mild pine hopping . the malt is crackery and crisp and blends well with the other flavors going on during the sip . m - grainy , light bodied , and crisp . d - marginal . i did n't finish mine and left about a third in the glass . ( there 's 1200 other reviews for this beer - is someone really reading this
**this** **is** **a** **pretty** **decent** **brew** . ignore it 's recent trendiness , and just enjoy it for what it is : a clean , tasty , well made **pale** **ale** **.** **pours** **a** **light** **amber/orange** **color** **,** **with** **a** **decent** **2** **fingers** **of** **head** **and** **some** **lacing** aroma is a bit lacking , with notes of chemicals , subtle hops and raspberry iced tea . the flavor is initially steely and similar to your average lager , but then some hops join in and you get a decent bitter kick . aftert that , some honey joins in and some fruitiness and more hops on the finish . well balanced , but lacking in flavor . mouthfeel is slick and creamy , with decent carbonation . drinkability is high . i would have no problem with this as a sesher . overall , pretty good , but it seems like magic hat could truly make something spectacular out of this instead of dumbing it down for a mass audience .
i drank this from the tap into a **pint** glass **.** **the** **beer** **pours** **a** **surprising** **dark** **color** **,** **copper** **with** **a** **light** **tan** **head** **,** **not** **much** **retention** **or** **lacing** . the aroma is lots of hops , seems like some cascade but that is it , not very balanced . the taste is light hops throughout with an unwelcome metallic finish . the feel is ok and drinkability is cut back by the metal aftertaste . to me its not an pale ale but an ipa and so-so one at that .
**this** **lager** **pours** **gold** **in** **color** **with** **a** **medium** **soapy** **head** . the light aroma of hops and light malts is present . creamy without the associated sweetness ; very smooth , velvety mouthfeel is light and a bit watery for my personal taste . very easy drinkability due to its light and non-complex mix . overall , this brew is a nice one for a hot summer day , though not complex enough to hold my interest .
12 oz . bottle poured into a pint **glass** **pours** **a** **very** **cloudy** **pale** **straw** **color** **with** **a** **minimal** **white** **head** that does n't last very long . pleasant aroma , soft , spicy wheat , some coriander and background notes of citrus . taste is pretty good , dry and refreshing with some orange/citrus fruitiness , more soft , spicy wheat , some spices in the background and a pleasant tartness in the finish . low bitterness . light-medium body , high carbonation and a generally creamy mouthfeel despite being fairly dry . overall this is a pretty decent beer . i enjoyed it but i 'm really not left wanting another .
serving type - 22oz bottle **appearance** **-** **dark** **as** **night** **,** **black** **oil** **,** **creamy** **thick** **2** **inch** **head** **,** **tons** **of** **lacing** , o yes smell - roasted malts , oak , wood , chocolate , coffee , dark fruits , whiskey , cocoa , a little vanilla and alcohol also . taste - strong malty chocolate and oaked/whiskey start this beer out . lots of coffee flavors add the typical bitterness of ris 's . the oaked flavor is a mix of bourbon , vanilla and dark fruits like plum and rasin . alcohol warm in each drink , as is cocoa and roasted malts mouthfeel - big beer , mouth wrecker . tounge gets coated with malts , chocolate and alcohol . palette gets more malts , whiskey and some hop flavored dark fruits . aftertaste is a little bitter and alcohol warmth is still there . overall - just like every other yeti , this is fantastic . oaked flavor shines with the classic yeti chocolate/coffee flavor we all love . treat this session beer as it is , once a year crack it open and enjoy the special barrel aged goodness . must try for yeti , ris and oaked beer fans .
**pours** **a** **huge** **head** **with** **decent** **retention** and a **nice** **orange** **color** that indicates caramel malts caramel malts with a decently assertive hoppiness . caramel and pale malts in this one help round the beer out and balancing hop bitterness that is piney and citrusy . crisp yet slightly creamy mouthfeel that go well with the sweet caramel malts . nice ipa woth good malt sweetness and an aggressive hop bitterness . reviewed on my phone
**appearance** **:** **pours** **a** **hazy** **,** **orange-copper** **body** **with** **a** **thin** **,** **wispy** **off-white** **head** **.** smell : aroma of caramel malt and fresh citrus fruits with lesser notes of grass and buttery diacetyl . taste : caramel maltiness with a medium amount of sweetness . light buttery hints . hunks of juicy grapefruit . medium bitterness and acidity - finishes same . mouthfeel : medium-bodied . medium carbonation . slick mouthfeel . drinkability : diacetyl or no , it 's still an okay ipa .
( served in an american pint glass **)** **a-** **this** **beer** **pours** **a** **hazy** **golden** **orange** **body** **with** **a** **white** **head** **of** **big** **rocky** **bubbles** . the carbonation is lots of big bubbles similar to soda pop s- the smell fresh green pine hops is strong with a note of caramel malt in the background . as it warms there is notes of citrus and more orange in the hops t-the initial taste is nice juicy green hops with hints of pine and very faint watermelon . this is followed by a nice malt flavor of caramel , biscuit and honey flavors . the finish has a nice hop bitterness that hangs on your breath . the finish has a slight dryness to it m- this beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with a slight creaminess from the fizz . the fizz is noticed more in the finish d- the hops were a big player but not punishingly big . there was good complexity in the malt , lots of nice soft layers give this beer good depth . i 've never tasted watermelon as a hop quality before but it is a positive one in this beer .
thanks to edbeer for bringing this one out . 500ml corked and caged bottle **.** **pours** **a** **semi-hazy** **burnt** **orange** **with** **no** **head** **,** **just** **a** **thin** **,** **tight** **white** band around the bowl . nose expresses citrus rind , cork , a hint of spice and a trace of something sweet ; perhaps candi sugar . taste is much more muted than suggested by the nose . citrus prevails , as well as a medicinal quality . there 's also light fruit and toasted malt presence in the flavor profile . mouthfeel is light-medium with a slight acidity and minimal carbonation - not quite still , but close to it . overall , not a bad brew - a little dull for the style and definitely lacking in sweetness . alcohol is dangerously well-hidden . that said , i do n't see this beer improving much with age , so drink up .
**malt** is a word that i 'd use to describe this **bad** **boy** **pours** **with** **a** **nice** **head** and is a **dark** **brown** with a bit of red/amber cast to it . i poured mine with a **ton** **of** head on it which lasted quite some time the first taste , i got a lot of foam and got hit with the malt then a bit of metalic taste . i 'm not sure about the metalic taste but it did n't come back for the rest of the glass . this is a big beer with a ton of taste and for those that are in to large malts , this is one to try .
**clear** **straw** **yellow-light** **gold** **with** **a** **low** **white** **head** **that** **leaves** **a** **bit** **of** **lace** . light spicy citrus hop aroma and light grainy malt aroma . tastes much like it smells with great balance . light bodied with a lemony hop finish . label states : 'light bodied american wheat beer judiciously hopped with cascade and tettnang hops ' & 'dry hopped ' . wish non-americans would judge us by these types of beers vs
**pours** **a** **dark** **brown/black** **with** **a** **thin** **rimming** **of** **tan** **head** **.** smell has roasted malt , some chocolate and hints of coffee . taste is heavy with coffee and roast . like a roasted latte taste with some chocolate twinges . finish is a bit muddy , with a noticeable but kind of fleeting roasted after-taste . drinks very smooth . has a lighter body than most imperial stouts and the 8 % is n't there in taste at all .
**pours** **a** **beautiful** **dark** **reddish** **brown** **with** **thin** **off-white** **head** **and** **copious** **sticky** **lace** . smells bready and yeasty with just a hint of caramel malt and faint chocolate . surprisingly , little in the way of raspberry aroma . smooth and creamy mouthfeel with prominent late carbonation taste is complex with typical brown ale caramel sweetness giving way quickly to overpowering tart raspberry and ending with a clean dry finish . alcohol is well masked by the tartness , but sneaks up on you quick . tartness is a bit out of balance and tarnishes other good flavors . a fine winter seasonal , sure to please beer afficionados and family members who like fruity concoctions as well . one by the fire is great , but i do n't think it would make a good session beer for me .
poured into a .3 liter **weizen** **glass** **.** **swirled** **around** **the** **last** **inch** of beer to get the yeast active and top it off nicely **.** **cloudy** as a bavarian hefe weizen should be . the aroma reminds me of a distinctive clove smell . the taste is very nice , smooth yet not bland , phenolic flavor . compared to other bavarian weizens , this is not too far from the crowd but it doesnt get mistaken for something else . this helles weizen is a great beer for a hot summer day . refreshing to the last drop .
on tap at the pub , 5 september 2009 . brought to the **table** **with** **a** **good** **head** still on it **.** **standard** **deep** **amber** **colored** **body** **beneath** **an** **off-white** **head** **.** **slightly** **hazy** **.** **good** **head** **retention** **and** **lacing** . the aroma delivers yeasty fruitiness , a wide caramelish-malt base , and mild english hops . pleasantly surprising , the red eye is a malty english-style ale with a medium to slightly dark caramel malt base , a berry-like fruitiness from the yeast , and minty and leafy hops . a firm bitterness acts as ballast , and it 's tightly tied together and balanced i found it readily drinkable , and quite enjoyable . quite nice
bottle from a mixed 12-pack from green 's on ponce in **atlanta** . **pours** **one** **shade** **away** **from** **black** **with** **light** **brown** **highlights** **and** **a** **one-finger** **tan** **head** **.** **the** **head** **recedes** **into** **a** **wispy** **layer** **on** **top** **leaving** **light** **lacing** . smells of roasted and black malts with good hints of unsweetened chocolate . as it warms the black malt aromas come out a bit more . tastes similar to how it smells . black and roasted malt flavors up front are joined by hints of cocoa midway through the sip that disappear before a mildly bitter ending . mouthfeel is good . it has a solid thickness with moderate carbonation . drinkability is good . i did n't have a problem finishing the bottle and could have another . overall this was a solid schwarzbier and one that i would visit again . the flavors are n't as dark as others i 've had in the style and the flavors integrate well . worth a shot .
review # 2,500 for bell **'s** **two** **hearted** ale 12oz bottle dated 5/11/11 poured into a **pint** glass . **a** **-** **pours** **a** **hazy** **,** **copper-orange** **with** **a** **1.5-2** **finger** **fluffy** **off-white** **head** **.** **good** **head** **retention** **with** **a** **little** **lacing** . s - floral and piney hops largely make up the nose . lots of fruits - grapefruits , light peaches , and a zesty citrus . nice pale malt backbone . t - soft , smooth pale malts with a caramel sweetness bring way to a well-balanced and fresh hop profile . the hops bring piney , citrusy , and light fruity flavors to your tastebuds . extremely well balanced beer . only a moderate bitterness with a dry finish . m - medium bodied with a fine carbonation . o - this is a very drinkable beer and priced quite nicely too . very refreshing during the hot summer months , but it 's a nice go-to during the winter months too when you 're lacking that ipa kick . great all around example of the style .
**a** **:** **pours** **a** **clear** **golden** **yellow** **.** **inch** **of** **head** , it runs into **a** **bubbly** **lacing** that clings on for a long while . s : clean grain , a snap of noble hallertau hops . t : clean malt , a touch of grainy sweetness . there is a discernible hallertau hop presence , followed by a citrusy twang . smooth like trinkwasser . m : good for the style . light and airy ; a little cream . d : quaff 'em down in the july heat : ) good pils ... friesland is special to me . my uncle 's name beings with fries ... ( he was also born in deutschland ... us army parents . )
i drank this from the bottle into a pint glass . **the** **beer** **pours** **a** **medium** **to** **dark** **gold** **with** **a** **huge** **light** **tan** **head** **that** **rises** **about** **3** **fingers** **but** **does** **n't** **have** **great** **retention** . tons of **carbonation** **.** **lacing** is ok . the aroma is light mostly some skunk with a little sweetness at the end the taste is light get a little sweetness but mostly weak hops and skunky . the feel is terrible its very light , almsot **water-like** . the beer is pretty drinkable overall , this is n't very taste but i ca n't believe its got 8.2 % abv . you would n't think it for a second . if you just want to drink something watery and get cracked this is the beer for you .
i bought this at capone 's in pa . poured into **a** **tulip** **a** **lighter** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **thick** **tightly** **bubbled** **heading** **.** **left** **some** **lacing** throughout . smell very hoppy . sweeter aroma 's pull through as well . some maltiness . taste and mouth is very smooth and bubbly.hops right off the bat and a nice maltiness that does n't go unnoticed . full bodied and **great** retention . drinkability good . not an overkill of hops and a nice maltiness suits this drink very well . i was suprosed by this one .
**this** is my father 's version of a 'heavy ' beer **,** **so** he **usually** has some around when i go visit him . it **does** **have** **an** **attractive** **pale** **yellow** **color** **,** unlike some other **macros** that look **too** **yellow** for my tastes because they remind me of urine . it did have a slight aroma that was pleasant but faint . the taste is barely drinkable after it warms even a touch , so drink it cold if you must drink it . feels like carbonated water and the aftertaste prevents me from drinking very many of them . often times i pass on them when dad offers . in college we used to say 'any beer is better than no beer . ' i 'm not sure i can say that today .
**pours** **extremely** **dark** , very close **to** **black** **with** **brown** **head** **that** **disappears** **fairly** **quick** . at initial pour roasted aroma pleasantly filled the air . roasted notes mix with a touch of chocolate and coffee . taste is similar to aroma . a touch of roasted dryness at first sip follows sweet aftertaste . a bit sticky mouthfeel , but overall it 's medium body . very smooth and i find it extremely drinkable honestly , i am not that familiar with porters to debate whether it fits the style . looking over bjcp guidelines , it seems to certainly fit the description for robust porter . now perhaps it 's the name of the style that misleading because certainly i do not find this beer robust ( the term creates an expectation of extreme roasted character for me ) . however , regardless of style or name , i find it drinkable and enjoyable .
**if** i were marketing this , i 'd call it an **oatmeal** ale . it 's **not** a **stout** -- **not** thick enough -- but it 's certainly tasty . **chocolate** , **coffee** , and a lightly sweet finish ; **medium-full** **body** **,** **decent** **head** **(** **pours** out of the bottle-neck like **a** **lazy** **geyser** **)** **;** **lovely** **golden-brown** **color** **you** ca n't always rely on price @ trader joe 's to point you to the good beers ; this one is among the cheapest they offer ( $ 4.99/6pk ) . this is a good barbecue brew . a pleasant surprise overall and a sleeper hit .
from the 12oz bottle **.** **pours** **a** **clear** **copper** **with** **a** **creamy** **ivory** **head** **.** **some** **lacing** . fruity malt in the nose along with some spicy , cutting hops . as you sip , lightly fruity apple flavors , some pale malt and then a middling persistent hoppiness , a slow burn of hops . lightly metallic . crisp up front and creamy going down . real smooth better than i expected . more like a english bitter than english pale ale imo . solid brew .
**coming** **in** a 500ml bottle , bb 27/01/11 , served chilled **in** a pint-size weizen glass . **a** **:** **dark** **yellow-ish** **straw** **in** **colour** **,** **pillowy** **white** **froth** , high level of carbonation . s : lightly sweet grainy , lightly grassy , plus a hint of sour dough . a swirl manages to bring out a bit more of malt sweetness . understated overall but not unpleasant or 'cheap ' . t : clean palate , the flavour balance gears towards lager malts plus a little sourness of most lager beer , but the residual grassy taste , 'plastic ' undertone of dry , northern german pilsener , and a lightly dry palate in the aftertaste do ring a bell of hops . not much unpleasant grainy or cheap-adjunct flavour is left in the end - rather , it 's quite clean and neutral in taste . m & d : quite fizzy but not over the top , the body is light but not really thin , and the overall performance tells the story of an easy-drinking lager beer that is neither attractive nor below quality . an ok beer , i 'd say .
12 oz bottle **.** **pours** **golden** **,** with **a** **large** **,** **foamy** **,** **white** **head** **,** **good** **lacing** . aroma is of grassy hops , maybe some malt in the background . light , slightly crisp body . flavor of hops and biscuit malt , practically no finish . exceeded my very low expectation .
poured into a perfect pint glass once i got off from work today . it was syrupy think coming out the bottle . **pitch** **black** **with** **a** **moderate** **brown** **head** **that** **leaves** **a** **nice** layer on top of the beer . coffee is the dominating smell and i love the pleasant rich and boldness . hints of brown sugar and molasses add some good sweetness to the aroma as well the beer provided a great conundrum for me , sweet black coffee . the coffee roastiness is more powerful than the sweetness , but it is still fairly balanced . the roastiness also provides a good bitterness in the finish . the mouthfeel is chalkier than i would have liked and a bit more creaminess would have helped . fairly easy to drink and one i would love to have most mornings for breakfast .
**hopped** with galaxy and warrior hops . on the handpump . a : the dipa **is** **a** **golden** **orange** **,** **hazed** **over** **,** **with** **a** **thick** **white** **head** keeping it company **.** **the** **head** **leaves** **strata** **of** **lace** behind . s : the nose is hoppy , no two ways about that . thick citrus is plentiful and biting . the strength of the nose makes the ale seem like its been aged for a spell . t : as in the nose , the ale is very thick , treacly with hops . the citrus loses its way , too thick and heavy . the bitterness is bold and does n't subside , even if it ca n't be rationally described . the lack of carbonation is acceptable , settling down the hop body . a step towards the right direction . m : the mouthfeel is big and stroong , dominated by bitterness and thick flavors
sampled at the 2003 pizza **port** **strong** **ale** **festival** . ( only on tap inside the restaurant ) you know a beer might be deadly if a brewpub is only selling it in 3oz and 6oz sizes . ( good price on those sizes too ) beer comes in a small taster **glass** **with** **no** **head** and **is** **deep** **milk** **chocolate** **brown** **with** **ruby** **highlights** **aroma** is of dark caramel coating raisins and plums . surprisingly , there is no discernible alcohol sensation in the nose . flavor matches the nose with long luscious strands of caramel wending their way around your mouth . before long the malt seems as narcotic as hops can be the finish strings into raisin and cherry fruits with a touch of roast , but finally as the beer passes to your throat that alcohol warming kicks in and traces a line all the way through .
2011 vintage , foil wrapped 750ml into a dfh signature glass . a - **pitch** **black** **body** **with** **a** **huge** **dark** **mocha** **head** **.** **tons** **of** **lacing** **and** **retention** **.** **looks** pretty damn good . s - probably the best part of this beer . huge coffee/espresso presence . roasted malts , vanilla and milk chocolate . slight hint of alcohol . t - very smooth mouth feel . roasted malts , smooth coffee , and chocolate . not very bitter or alcoholic o - a good coffee stout , but certainly not the best out there . the smell was fantastic , but the taste really did n't stand out . perhaps i should have had this when it was fresher and the coffee was more prevalent . will seek out again next year
**looks** **like** **swamp** **water** **,** **the** **head** is **white** and short lived . spice and citrus zest on the nose . pitch perfect acidity is the calling card of dark white . it sneaks in on the entry , but builds strength in route to the finish . its not funky or bretty or sour , this is the kind of acidity you get from a nice sauvignon blanc or champagne . it makes the mouth water . beyond the crisp acidity and beautiful finish . it has a light metallic note with good citrus character and lingering earthy notes . the finish is crisp and satisfying . sharp on the tongue . bright , refreshing , but full bodied . wow , talk about looks being decieving . no darker flavor notes at all , no real malt character . just a tremendous saison with a zip of acidity . fantome continues its excellence with this one .
tried this at the san **diego** **festival** **of** **beer** **.** **had** **a** **golden/amber** **color** **and** **not** **much** head to speak of . smells like an ipa should , lots of hops , grapefruit and pine . malt is there in the taste but barely . the floral piney hops dominate . very solid ipa . not quite up to par with blind pig but very good nonetheless .
1st dec . 2011 into a **leffe** chalice vintage **,** **3** years old . if the product is good , oxydation is coming . do n't keeping any longuer . i was a bit disapointed by the lack of 'roundness ' of it . maybe because of the age ? for other beers it did not happen so often ...
**hello** to my beer advocate family ! this is my 1st review and i got ta tell you from the gate ... i am an enjoyer ... not a reviewer ; but i will give it a wirl ! picked up a 4 pack from beverage world today @ 16.99 **dfh** glass included ... woohoo ... love those free glasses ! put it in my kegerator for several hours to reach optimum temp . before cracking open . anyway since i am a lover of most big beers vs **normal** beers ; is there such a thing ? this one did not disappoint . enjoying now with some goodies i picked up from arthur ave . in da bronx ... bottled on 05/27/09 ; got ta love dfh for that info . the nose is full of fresh malt and rum . **the** **creamy** **light** **chocolate** **looking** **head** was a little on the small side probably due to the lower carbonation mouthfeel of this brew , but it **did** **leave** **nice** **sticky** **lace** on my new beer clean dfh glass . my taste buds picked up raisins , lots of malt and a hint of vanilla.the ac came in midway ... well hidden for 12 % in taste but not the buzz . overall another tasty treat from one of my favorite brewerys
**pours** **with** **a** **light** **brown** **,** **one-fingered** **head** **,** **fades** **quickly** **,** **leaves** **hardly** **any** **lace** . medium carbonation and medium bodied . color is a **dark** **,** **cloudy** **amber** . nose is raisiny . starts and finishes sweet and raisiny . nice beer for this winter weather . pricey , $ 4.30 for a 330ml bottle .
**appearance** **-** **dark** **brown** **smell** - sweet aroma taste - complex burst of flavors mouth feel - not dry , very sweet drinkability - as it warms up the caramel and brown sugar sweetness becomes very noticeable . nice burst of complex flavors but very sweet and not dry - great
**a-** **very** **small** **one-fingered** **white** **head** **on** top of a mid-golden body . a couple dozen **streams** of carbonation coming up from the tulip **bottom** **.** **head** is **short** **lived** **...** **leaves** **a** **decent** **amount** **of** **lacing** . s- floral hops and citrus smell ... .somewhat faint . t- very ( ! ) bitter hop profile . german malts make their presence known for sure . m- medium to thicker mouthfeel . nice carbonation sting ... might be my favorite part about this beer . d/o- very different than the 'usual ' dipa i was expecting . color for one was a little on the light side ... no matter ... a tasty brew from victory . hop wallop ... a fitting name .
**appearance** **:** **poured** **with** **nice** **very** **creamy** **tan** **head** **that** **dissipated** **leaving** **nice** **lacing** down my glass . the beer is clear with a very **dark** **reddish-brown** **color** that lets a little light through smell : sweet toasted malt , biscuit , sweet ripe berries and plums , woody oak , a little alcohol , and a very small dry peppery/earthy spice toward the end taste : sweet roasted malt , sweet plums and cherries , very small hoppy character , strong oak flavor , and a small metallic flavor . the flavors are a little bit light toward the end mouthfeel : medium-light body , a little bit watery for the style , nicely carbonated , a bit of a dry feeling , then leaves mouth pretty clean overall : great drinkability , very nice flavors . sweet dark fruit , roasted malt , and oak flavors are all very well balanced . it is a little thinner than i would like and there is a small metallic flavor but other than that this is a great beer ! wonderful character throughout .
on tap at **the** **sounds** **game** **a-** **bright** **orange** **with** **a** **two** **finger** **head** **s-** malt and spices . almost orange citrus hints . t- sweet malts/ mild spice followed with a tartness and a crisp citrus end m- light bodied followed by mild carbonation d- fairly high , easy drinking . they offered lime as well , which my wife took-but i preferred without .
to be **perfectly** honest this is an **average** **dunkel** **,** **fairly** solid **in** all categories but average for the style . i have enjoyed this beer in the past and i continue to enjoy drinking some of these from time to time . pours **very** **dark** **for** **a** **dunkel** **and** **produces** **a** **thick** **foamy** **head** that ultimately **turns** to **a** **thin** **film** **.** **minimal** **lacing** slowly creeps down the glass and i am not able to determine the carbonation since i can not see through my glass . the aroma is malty , sweet , and bitter . i gave it a below average rating only because the aroma is very hard to detect , i 'm forced to shove my nose down into my glass in order to pick up any scent . the flavor is definitely based on the original lager , but it appears to be altered with some sweet malts . the combination is very good and i sure do enjoy the overall taste of this one . the mouthfeel is decent not too thin and the finish is clean and smooth . all in all a well rounded beer for this style .
**poured** into **a** **pint** **glass** **and** **received** **a** **one-finger** **head** **that** stuck around due to carbonation . a mix between between copper and oragne is how i would describe the **light** **,** **seethru** **body** . a strong smell eminates , giving off a strong hop presence but also underlined by a small malt and bread presence with a hint og citrus . the beer has a ryeish , dry hop taste that contains earthy tones and is not very complex but good . balanced out by the malts for a refreshing , smooth ale that keeps you wanting more . i would n't session this beer , one or two is fine and perhaps i was a overly critical since i know samuel smith makes better beers .
**poured** from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass . i aquired this beer in a trade with hyland24 a **-** **looked** **like** **a** **glass** **of** **murky** **swamp** **water** . it was **a** **cloudy** **light** **yellow** **color** **with** **a** **finger** **or** **two** **of** **off-white** **head** . not much light getting through at all . s - very yeasty , like country bread . i also got hints of ripe fruit ( banana ) and some citrus . t - lots of yeast up front , followed by a sweet almost banana-lke flavor . it was n't like real bananna though , it was more like banana candy , like bananna now & laters , or laffy taffy . i also detected a tiny bit of citric bitterness in the finish . mf & d - the sweetness was good , but not overpowering and the flavor coated my mouth well . this beer came to me very highly touted , i would have to say it lived up to its billing . my only regreat is having only 1 bottle to sample , i think this one would have gotten even better after a few more .
making itself at home in my terrapin pint glass **,** **'dos** cocoas **'** **chocolate** **porter** **is** **the** **color** **of** **oil-stained** **ebony** **and** **is** **trimmed** **with** **mahogany-tinted** **garnet** **highlights** at the periphery . **a** **grainy-bubbled** **cap** **of** **soft** **khaki** **foam** **relaxes** **quickly** **into** **a** **soapy** **sheet** **too** soft to leave more **than** **token** **freckling** **of** **lacing** on the glass . the smell is dark and chocolatey , with mild , smoky , near-burnt caramel and a lightly acrid whiff of charred grain . a tang of fruity , cocoa-dusted malt becomes stronger as the drink warms a bit . the taste is mild and milky with a touch of sweetly-bland roasted gourdfruit , dilute unsweetened hot cocoa mix , and a dusting of bakers ' chocolate . the mild lactic sweetness is nicely accented in the finish by mellow , coffee-like bitterness , and a silky note of cream-heavy mocha drizzled in dark caramel lingers in the aftertaste . earthy , powdery-dry cocoa becomes much more prominent as the drink progresses . the drink is light-bodied and mildly carbonated and is really quite easy to drink . a nice , subtle beer that is very well-made and quite delicious .

**in** **honor** of st . patrick 's day - 16 fl . nitro-can served in my sam smith nonic . **poured** **with** **a** **cascading** **,** **creamy/frothy** **head** **that** **eventually** coalesces into **a** **two** **inch** **dense** **,** **tan-colored** **cap** **.** **head** **eventually** **settles** into a **solid** **one** **inch** **cap** **with** **thick** **sheets** **of** **lacing** **coating** the sides of the glass and exhibiting excellent adherence . appearance is a **dark** **brown** **with** **ruby** **highlights** around the edges and **when** **backlit** . nose is subtle - dry with a hint of roast . taste follows nose , with the addition of an expression of light , toasted malt , a slightly watery quality and a metallic flavor that peaks out at the finish . mouthfeel is light-bodied , with the consistency of watery milk . pretty good drinkability for the style and really quite easy to session , although my preference is for guinness draught .
**the** **beer** **poured** **with** **a** **clear** **,** **golden** **color** **with** **somewhat** **creamy** **lacing** on the sides but **a** **generally** **thin** head . aromas were a bit thin but had a nice touch of summery aromas including some apple , peach , pear mixed with hops . taste had that typical dry bitterness , but it was light and watery enough to make this a relaxing summer drink . a slight carbonated punch at the end of every sip , i could picture myself out on the deck of some restaurant drinking this with a nice meal . if only this new england summer did not suck . ah well . overall , a refreshing drink from harpoon .
this is my first review so i figured id review my **most** **popular** **session** **beer** appearance : 12 oz bottle **,** **it** **bsically** **looks** **like** **yellow** **water** **,** **urine** like . taste : taste of cereal , water an a hint of metal of some sort , not over powering but deffinitly detectable on the palate . goes down smooth as a glass of water mouthfeel : kind of fuzzy feel on the tongue drinkability : exceptionalin my opinion , i mean its like drinking water , if you just want to get drunk i suggest this beer , not much on taste though ladies love miller lite
**pours** **amber** **with** **a** **thick** **foam** **that** **has** **good** **retention** **with** **decent** **lacing** all the way down . hoppy , some pine and citrus going for it . taste is similar , hoppy upfront with the citrus then going into a malt backing to balance it out mouthfeel is medium and creamy . drinkability is pretty good , the 8.3 % abv is n't noticeable and i could have another with ease .
**a** **nice** **lighter** **,** **somewhat** **sweet** aroma with phenol present , with some spiciness . pleasant overall . **pours** **with** **a** **big** **full** **chalk** **white** **head** **that** **laces** **alright** . light **gold** to **yellow** and **mildly** **cloudy** . light overall flavor , lacking the dominace of flavors one would expect , such as citrus or coriander . wheat is a little light too . quite a bit more hop dryness than i noted in others of style . a little too sour . has a refreshing quality to it . average body . higher carbonation . not a great example of style , but if in point , worth a try . actually , it 's being promoted strongly , as it was n't that difficult to find in several areas of wisconsin . appreciate the brewery 's willingness to try something new and different .
picked this up at keag market in **so** . thomaston , they had a few six packs of this sitting in the fridge so why not try one . **pours** **a** **beautiful** **dark** **brown** . though the smell is a bit odd , not sure how to nail it until i tasted it . this is different , a bit like dried fruit , sweet malt and licorice . mouthfeel is allright . overall drinkability ? well very different , not appealing at first although it seems like something i could like as i have five more of these . if so and edit of this will be on hand , but right now , this is just way different . after drinking the rest i 'm not too keen on the licorice flavor . this may be just a weird batch . i am willing to try this again .
poured this 22 oz . brown bottle into a becker . a heavy **pour** **created** **over** **three** **fingers** **of** **creamy** **tan** **head** . the body is dark **brown/ruby** **in** color and no light shines through . no date on the bottle , but i have had this for more than six months smell was lightly smoky taste was toasted malts . there was a lingering pleasant bitterness . this one demonstrated a well balanced gentle tanginess i expect from a good porter . mouthfeel was medium to thin . the carbonation level was mild to medium . seems to be a solid porter , although not too complex . although this one may be a tad elderly .
**pours** **a** **mahogany** **brown** **with** **copper** **hues** **by** **the** **rim** **.** **light** **head** **subsides** to a nice film and **a** **rather** **thick** **collar** **.** **slight** lacings a pleasant surprise . full chocolate malt nose , hearty with nicely toasted scents and a slight fruitiness ( raisin and date ) . reminds me of some simple dark sherries i 've enjoyed recently . light orangy hop notes . medium bodied with light carbonation . thick palate of milk chocolate , cocoa , toasted cocoa nibs , small amounts of cafe au lait , and a touch of tangerine hop influence . clean yeast profile with a slight mustiness inn the aftertaste . if there 's a coffee crusted filet with vanilla sauce somewhere in the world , this would work wonders to match . my thanks to himerman who sent me three bottles to enjoy ! bro , they went way to fast .
**poured** **ink** **black** **with** **a** **nice** **brown** **head** **and** **good** **lacing** **and** **head** **retension** . absolutely no light coming through this brew . nice chocolaty smell . some fruit up front with a nice chocolate presence and a mild bitter finish creamy mouthfeel and i thought it had pretty good drinkability . i 'm do n't have a lot of experience with stouts , but i thougt this was very good , just not the best i 've had .
**on** **cask** **at** **the** **brazen** **head** **.** **poured** **a** **pale** **copper** **hue** **with** **a** **one** **finger** **foamy** **white** **head** **.** **there** **was** **decent** **retention** **and** **very** **good** **lacing** the smell featured a solid noble hop with a hint of doughy caramel grain the taste consisted of am earthy hop spice with a soft cereal malt the mouthfeel was average for the style oveall a tasty and sessionable lager .
**i** was **not** **very** **impressed** with the esb **so** i 'm a little hesitant of this one . **i** **do** like the dubbel though , **so** **who** **knows** **.** **appearance** **-** **looks** **really** good going into the glass **.** **an** **amber** **colored** **beer** that is **brilliantly** **clear** and very nicely carbonated which is **feeding** **a** **nice** **constant** **head** **and** **gobs** **of** **lacing** . aroma - some pine hops with a light touch of citrus . taste - a little harsh and piney up-front that fades into a nice malty wash . good bitterness in the finish that lingers . each sip is a flavorful transition from harsh and flavorful , to sweet and soothing , to bitter and anticipating . mouthfeel & drinkability - i think the body on this is really good for style , maybe a hair on the light side that keeps me hungry for the next sip . i am very impressed with this beer . this is definitely one of the easiest beers for me to drink . btw - the lacing just never gives up
had **this** at the end of the humourous and uninformative castlemaine-perkins brewery tour . **did** **n't** **dare** **bother** with **the** **fourex** **a** **:** **mahogany** **brown** **with** **nice** **beige** **head** **that** **lasted** for about a **minute** . s : pleasant , but weak . fresh hops and caramel . t : good , especially compared to xxxx 's other offerings . well-balanced hops and malt . m : maybe slightly thin and over-carbonated . d : i downed it .
2006 vintage 22oz bottle , poured into a **maudite** **snifter** **pours** **an** **amber-brown** **color** **with** **bright** **orange** **highlights** **when** held up to the light . **appealing** aroma of sweet dark and caramel malts , dark fruit , and some brown sugar , along with a noticeable alcohol presence . palate is a rich and complex blend of malty sweetness , dark fruit , and brown sugar up front . a subtle hoppy bitterness emerges before the swallow and lingers long into the aftertaste , balancing things out a bit . notes of figs and prunes come through on the finish . body is velvety smooth , a great complement to the rich intermingling of flavors in the palate . very drinkable for such a strong beer , and the perfect accompaniment to a bowl of mushroom barley soup on a cold night . as usual , a wonderful offering from stone .
from a fresh sixer of the 2008 offering . served at just over fridge temperature in an english imperial **pint** glass **,** and paired with sweet italian **chicken** sausages for dinner . **appearance-** **pours** **a** **rich** **,** **deep** **clear** **copper** **with** **a** **terrific** **three** **finger** **head** **that** **remains** **like** **soapsuds** **atop** **the** beer . this is a malty brew on the eyes alone ... reminds me of fuller 's esb with its depth of **hue** **smell-** sweet and malty , with a nose of cream soda ( subtle and vanillalike , bordering on root beer ) . soft aromas that waft gracefully in the air . taste- sweet and bready , the malts carry this experience from start to almost the very finish ... it 's a consistent , and eventually predictable journey over the tongue . props for balance and elegance , as the final hop bitterness gently rounds out the malts and dries the palate mouthfeel/drinkability- the velvety texture is punctuated by a crisp , slightly aggressive introduction that livens the tip of the tongue . slick as it is in the mouth , the swallow is n't magical as it might seem . it 's an easy , drinkable beer that could absolutely be enjoyed one after another at the poker table .
**a** **:** **a** **hazy** **gold** **color** **with** **a** **huge** **pillowy** **off-white** **colored** **head** **.** s : bready yeast aroma with some very strong alcohol , tropical fruit , and candy sugar . t : some bready , caramel malts with a strong alcohol flavor . tropical fruits and a faint concord grape in the background . a rather wickedly bitter aftertaste that shocks at first , but as you sip the initial shock wears off and mellows . m : peppery and high carbonation . a very dry/bitter aftertaste that mellows out after the beer warms . o : it 's a very good tripel . maybe a little too strong and dry for my tastes , but i served it too cold at first . when this beer warms it is fantastic , it opens up the flavors and they are excellent .
**has** **a** **nice** **brown** **hue** **with** **a** **decent** **head** **that** **leaves** **good** **lacing** . smell is inviting with a hint of caramel and spice , more subdued than other winter warmers i 've sampled . taste is also lighter than expected but nice nonetheless . no real trace of alcohol but a good amount of hop is used to complement the spice and darker malt . mouth was smooth and retained good carbonation . not such a bad winter warmer but definately less complex than most . does n't have that 'piney ' or 'sprucy ' character that some may like , but i find this more drinkable than most as i 'm not a big tree taste fan ... unless its maple .
**2004** **vintage** **:** **pours** **a** **murky** **mahogany** **with** **some** **ruby** **tint** **,** **and** **a** **thick** **,** **creamy** **tan** **head** **...** very nice especially for a cellared beer . the aroma is quite hoppy with big citrus ( tangerine , orange and lemon rind , grapefruit ) character , caramel sweetness , alcohol , toasted bread , and some esters . the flavor is quite hoppy initially with citrus and floral character , followed by some sweet caramel malt , fruity esters , alcohol and some toasted bread . while i enjoyed this beer , honestly it seemed too similar to their barleywine ( which is fantastic ) but i was expecting a much different beast than old ruffian and that is what this beer most resembles to me . the mouthfeel is chewy and rich and drinkability is good but the alcohol is somewhat warming . 2009 vintage : bottled on 11/19/2009 , ever so slightly less than a year old . **pours** **a** **slightly** **hazy** **mahogany** **color** **with** **a** **thin** **tan** **head** **that** **retains** **ok** . the aroma has a ton of sweet malts initially ( notes of caramel , bourbon , toffee , turbinado sugar ) along with some piney and citrusy hops in the background , along with some cocoa , pecans and almonds , dark fruits and some alcohol . the flavor has some citrusy and piney hops upfront ( but more muted compared to when fresh ) , along with caramel and toffee , rum cake , dark fruits , caramelized pecans , and some alcohol the mouthfeel is really smooth and drinkability is much improved . i 'm really digging this with a year on it , the hops have faded and the malts come to the forefront and the alcohol has really mellowed ... i 've got another bottle i 'll leave alone for a year or so to see how this one matures further .
**a** **-** **pours** **a** **clear** **copper-orange** **color** **with** **a** **finger** **of** **white** **head** **.** **the** **head** **fades** down to a thin right around the outside **leaving** **behind** **some** **lacing** in the process . s - aroma is a mix of piney and citrus hops and sweet caramel malts . there is also some more background fruits mixed in as well . t - starts off with sweet caramel malt and some citrus hop in the background . there is some other fruity flavors mixing around . through the middle , some stronger citrus hops some though with a bit of bitterness . the finish is a mix of some stronger hop flavor and caramel malts that linger nicely . m - medium bodied with moderate carbonation . smooth and crisp . the finish is a touch dry and bitter and kinda nice . d - very drinkable . the flavor could have used a bit more punch ( especially a bit more hop ) , but there is still a nice balance throughout the beer . the light fruit flavors were a nice addition and could have been a bit stronger .
**1** **liter** , poured in aventinus glass , then poured again , and again ... . **deep** **mahogany** **with** **a** **massive** **head** **demonstrating** **gradations** **of** **tan** **,** **slowly** **fell** **but** **left** **audacious** **,** **chunky** **clumps** **of** **lacing** . sharp attack , nicely subdued chocalety sweet with dark bready smells . delicious rich blend of roasted dark coffee , faint chocolate , and hazlenut tastes -- -molasses . palate has fine carbonation full big malty richness like heaven . delicious.easy to delight in . i 'm very happy .
**a** **:** **nice** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **quarter** **inch** **of** **off** **white** **head** that does not retain all that well **.** **some** **lace** . s : great rye notes ! very biscuity and the rye adds some spiciness . almost exactly like fresh bake rye bread . lots of carbonation rushes up from the glass and the hops provide a nice crispness . t : the hops come through a bit more when drinking . very crisp and herbal with a hint of pine as well . the rye flavor is spicy and bready but i think the hops overshadow them a bit . m : slightly boozy but pretty clean and crisp tasting . d : i could drink more but i think one is enough
found at fitger 's , august '07 . **this** **one** **looks** **a** **lot** **like** **coke** **with** **some** **cherry** **highlights** . when held to the light , this **baby** **glows** **.** **the** **head** was but **a** **little** **collar** . smells of prunes and then some more prunes . this is accompanied by a slight astringent alcohol with a light raisin and a bunch of other dark fruits . the dark fruit emphasis seems to be lacking balance . tastes of sweet brown sugar , maple syrup and huge prunes again . a light roasted coffee fades in to finish it off . feels light and dense that amplifies the sweetness a good intro to belgian flavors , but way to sweet and fruity for my liking .
**2011** **,** beer camp # **8** **.** **pours** **a** **clear** **golden** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **one** **finger** **foamy** **white** **head** **that** **quickly** **settles** **into** **a** **thin** **ring** **.** **minimal** **spots** **of** **lace** **left** behind . slightly earthy aroma with hints of pine and grassy hops along with some sweet pale malt notes . hints of biscuit and light caramel along with some light fruit , especially apricot . fuller boded than expected and the hop presence is much stronger than the aroma suggests . earthy , floral and dry up front but only slightly bitter with hints of grass , pine and soil . this is countered by a sweet malt presence with hints of caramel , toffee , biscuit and faint nuttiness . crisp , well balanced and easy to drink with a dry , spicy hop finish .
**this** **is** **a** **pint** glass of the new seasonal dunkel weizen served chilled . a : the ale **is** **a** **hazy** **light** **brown** **color** **with** **a** **small** **head** **and** **no** **lacing** . s : the ale has a bubblegum clove aroma that is quite sweet . t : the ale has the requisite clove and banana flavors that i 'd expect from a dunkel weizen but the beer seems to come just shy of being great . the flavors are too sweet . m : the mouthfeel is hurt a bit by the over-cloving . d : very drinkable , but i 'll stick to the vintage list thanks .
11.2 oz . bottle poured into my **hoegaarden** glass . a : **a** **really** **nice** **color** **.** **a** **unfiltered** **golden** that poured pretty flat without much carbonation . stills **looks** pretty darn good though . suspended yeast towards the bottom of the glass . s : wonderful aromas of orange peel & spice . much more aromatic then most wit 's i 've come across . t : a slightly tangy taste . the spices ( coriander , clove ) definately come through . the citrus flavor is also quite detectable . m : a refreshing mouthfeel ! the wheat flavor is really nice & dies off a bit toward the end to finish with a thinner feel .
**appearance** **:** **dispensed** **a** **light** **copper** **body** **,** **lightly** **hazed** and **capped** **with** **a** **finely-textured** **,** **white** **head** **.** smell : aroma of pale malts with a hint of sugary caramel . the hops ( chinook , sterling , and cascade ) throw off notes of fresh florals , citrus fruits , and ( lightly ) pine . taste : pale malts with a modest amount of supporting caramel sweetness . hop flavors present fresh orange peelings , white pine , and humble meadow flowers . medium bitterness . a bit more maltiness prior to the bittersweet finish . mouthfeel : medium-bodied . medium carbonation . smooth mouthfeel . drinkability : a decent india pale ale out of jailhouse . any hopheads looking to receive a curb-kicking of hop character and bitterness will be left wanting , but those seeking a balanced ipa should be pleased .
this might be another one of basil t 's year round **brews** . they did n't list this one in their beer menu , but the bartender told me that they had this one and it 's different **from** **thier** **red** **ale** . on tap on 3/8/08 and it was served to me in a **pilsner** glass . it **poured** **a** **light** **clear** **amber** **that** **had** **a** **thin** **head** **of** **white** **foam** **that** **quickly** **dissipated** into **a** **handful** **of** **white** **foamy** **rings** **,** **one** **streak** **of** **white** **lace** **,** and **a** **few** **spots** **of** **lace** . it had an unusual smoky aroma that contained green olives , wood , toasted malts , and a hint of caramel . then toward the bottom , the aroma started to get sour . what an odd aroma ! the taste started off faint with toasted malts and caramel . then halfway through , the taste all of a sudden became crispy with citrus hops and a slice of grapefruit . it was a light bodied beer that had a slightly malty and crispy aftertaste of toasted malts and citrus hops . it was just an average beer . i would n't mind ordering this beer again if it was the only thing they had .
on-tap at clark **'s** **ale** **house** **.** **appeared** **a** **lightly** **hazy** **straw** **yellow** **with** **a** **tall** **white** **head** . i thought this was a nice american take on the style . while the flavor focuses on crisp malt and herbal spices while the aroma is filled with smooth floral hops that make a great compliment to the grassy and citrus yeast character . like hops and saisons ? give this a try .
bottle was a 2006 gabf left-over that was given to me as a reward for my volunteer efforts . thanks a million to gabf and to backcountry for the opportunity **.** **pours** **nearly** **a** **finger** **of** **white** **clingy** **head** **.** **dirty** **pale** **blah** **yellow** **.** a little bit **greenish** **color** . not pretty . smells a little bit orange and hay . very mild and a touch metallic . tastes wet sweet . a touch grassy and some oranges . some sour tang . the sweet becomes a bit much . aftertaste show a mild and drying hop bitter . md body for the style and modest carbonation .
thanks to mikesgroove for this extra **this** **brew** **pours** **a** **light** **straw** **color** **and** **settles** **a** **haze** **infused** **yellow** **orange** **.** **2** **fingers** **of** **a** **chunky** **off** **white** **head** **sits** **forever..** the nose is clean and hoppy . fresh citrus , light pine , and a bit of caramel lingers . the taste is quite the same . some crisp , bitter offerings akin to grapefruit and pine . the malt bill is quite large but finishes with hop offerings easily applied . a sweet , buttered biscuit taste sits briefly and translates into a caramel taste . the mouthfeel is rich and creamy given the style . comes on flavorful and bold and ends crsip and a little dry overall , bomb ass ipa . full of flavor with a great nose and a smooth mouthfeel . pretty spot-on .
**amber-red** **with** **a** **thin** **white** **head** **that** **remains** **.** **good** **lacing** . smell is tart , fruity funk with some spicey notes . grapes , cherry , figs , and other fruity notes . curious metallic note in there as well . taste is strong belgian yeast and malts , with more tart funkiness , though less so than on the nose . peach , banana , figs , as well as green grapes are some of the fruits i can discern . peppery finish from the wild yeast . mouthfeel is crisp with a dry finish . nice bite on the tonue . medium-light body . drinkability is good . alcohol is well-hidden .
**golden** **amber** **in** **color** **,** smell is of malt , and hops . taste is hoppy but not so much as the 90 min ipa , a bit malty too . the head is white , **1** **finger** in **size** **and** **leaves** **moderate** **lacing** in the glass . goes well with red meat and pasta . very drinkable and enjoyable .
**i** **love** **the** **deep** **dark** **red** of this beer , a near **black** **cherry** **color** with a **tinge** of mahogany . served in a tulip glass , it has **a** **constant** head and a champagne-like stream of co2 coming from its depth . this is a nice looking glass of red flemish ale . the aroma is sharp . the cherry is there up front , and underneath the malt . but there is also a small bit of acrid aroma that i ca n't quite place . sour cherry hits the palate first , with enough sweetness to keep it interesting.as that fades away it becomes a little too sour . however , after about a minute or so , the finish is nice and malty . a strong start , a good finish , but an iffy middle . a good zip of carbonation keeps the mouthfeel lively , and a strong head gives a bit of a creamy texture . very nice indeed . if you 're a fan of flemish ale , this is a very nice beer . there are some things holding it back , but overall , a fine notch to put on one 's belt , so to speak .
**golden** **orange** **hazy** **color** **.** **white** **foam** **,** average **in** **compactness** and creamy . at the smell some fruitiness ( orange ) , honey , some flowers . some spiciness , too . decent smell , but nothing remarkable . the taste is fruity , light honey , a bit sweetie . hints of spiciness here and there ( coriander , pepper ) . decent , drinkable , but surely not the best of the brewery . orange , orange flowers . quite drinkable . in the aftertaste flowers and some spices . less sweet . some honey again , less strong . white flowers , orange .
bottle into pint **glass** **a-** **black** with no light passing thru and a **light** **oatmeal** head that remains strong . s- sweet roast malts . t- burnt malt with sweet milk on the backend . m- medium . very smooth and siky . a little coating remains , but not off-putting d- not bad for the style , but not one that i could have more than one of . i have had it on tap at the pub and remember a different beer ; both having a life of its own .
**hazed** **firm** **dark** **orangish** **color** **,** with a **murky** **miz** **of** **red** **and** **brown** also , it is interestin , a **fruit** **juice** **color** **.** **a** **full** **bright** **white** **fluffy** **head** **that** **has** **sporatic** **lacing** that has a lump in the middle , **looks** **like** a chunk of **ice** **cream** . sweet smooth fruity belgian aroma , of oranges and refreshing berries , tantilizing . sweet oranges , peaches , and grapes . a sweet sugary lemon citrus ring intitally , followed by the great fruit smorgasborg . a melon character to it as well , absolutely delicious . firm mouthfeel , so fruity and refreshing , a fantastic tripel .
**pours** **a** **reddish** **copper** **.** **nice** **and** **clear** **,** **good** **off-white** **head** **.** smells very spicy . i can smell the cinnamon for sure , some gingery smells also . very malty aroma . taste is malty and full . nice creaminess to it . the spices mellow out the finish . it 's pretty good . better than i expected as i 'm not big on the spiced beers , but this is n't overdone . mouthfeel is almost creamy with a crisp finish to it . overall i 'm impressed .
**poured** into **a** **tulip** **pours** **a** **slightly** **murky** copper/brownish . rumors of undercarbed are greatly exaggerated ; this baby is flat as a fritter . nose - holy oak bombs batman ! some bourbon and alcohol coming in behind . taste - very sweet front end . caramel , maybe brown sugar . it 'd almost be too much if the oak finish did n't clean things up with a dry burst at the end lack of carbonation is so disappointing . this beer would be epic with even a hint of body . i 've force-carbed it at home and it moves from good to great . excellent beer , in spite of the carb issue , glad i 've got some to lay down and age .
**this** **beer** **has** **a** really **cool** label **,** and a cool bottle . one the cork comes out , **the** **beer** **pours** **a** **slightly** **hazy** **golden** **color** **.** **the** **head** **retention** **is** **decent** , **and** **the** **foam** **creates** **a** **nice** **lace** around the glass . the aroma is wonderful . its a very full hop smell . the smell is strong , but not off putting , most likely due to the choice in hops . the taste is citrusy and clean . the malt profile is hard to describe , but its somewhat sweet , which compliments the aroma and bitterness well . this beer is a real treat .
on tap at max 's **today** **.** **the** **beer** **pours** **a** **striking** **gold** **color** **with** **good** **head** **retention** **and** **decent** **lacing** . on the nose and palate , this beer is just a thing of beauty . the beer displays a striking aroma of honey , bees wax and white pepper . the flavor profile replicates the nose , with the beer showing an impressive blend of light honey , bread dough , and peppery bitterness on the finish . mouthfeel is light , with the beer showing a crisp , clean finish . drinkability is quite good , with the alcohol barely an afterthought not that i 'm surprised , but this is a very well made pilsner style beer from victory .
**pours** **clear** **amber** **with** **a** **creamy** **white** **head** **with** **good** **retention** **and** **lacing** . aroma is a blast of cascade hops ( grapefruit , citrus ) , some floral esters as well . taste was another blast of cascade , with a sweet malty middle , and very long finish of hop bitterness . mouthfeel was crisp , but not soft like a pilsener . very drinkable , great on the patio and in the spring .
**i** feel lost abbey 's beers range from the **sublime** to the **mundane** . **this** beer had elements of both . the mouthfeel was incredible - had the **velvet** smoothness of an **oatmeal** **stout** , but also the effervescent **acidity** of a **saison** **.** **bright** **golden** **sunlight** in your eyeball - it was tantalizing . the aroma was lacking , almost nonexistent . wonder why either way this beer was very drinkable , and definitely would go quite well with some fried eggs or pommes frites .

presentation : 22 oz brown bomber , & # 8220 **;** **unfiltered** and unpasteurized , please refrigerate & # 8221 ; on the label . no freshness date . appearance **:** **bold** **orange** **amber** **colour** **with** **a** **mild** **chill** **haze** **,** **big** **frothy** **cream** **coloured** **head** **nearly** **over** **flows** and **seems** **to** **stick** all over the glass . smell : big time coriander with a floral hop in the back , fresh oranges with a hint of ester . taste : very creamy medium body with a luscious and smooth carbonation . a full and rounded sweetness with flavours of coriander and citric rind riding out its wake . hop bitterness is quite noticeable but not harsh , more of a pungent flavour that tries to meld with the fruitiness . estery alcohol flares a bit with fruity and mild solvent flavours . a tight spiciness opens up in the middle with a quick peppery note and a bite from the hops as well as a meek medicinal phenol that rounds the brew out . an underlying nuttiness from the yeast adds an other complex bite to the every growing hop flavour that is bothersome and oddly attractive at the same time . notes : this brew reminds me of some of the new upstarts in belgium and their generous use of hops in traditional styles as well as their own . a good paring would be with a plate of assorted pungent soft cheeses with whole grain rye crackers and fresh orange wedges to break up the flavours .
had a bottle recently at **a** **friends** **house** . appearance : poured into **a** **1/2** **mass** glass krug . came out with a nice deep red with a bit of lighter ( orangy ? ) **tones** **.** **2** **finger** **head** **that** **quickly** **disappeared** **with** **minimal** **lacing** . smell : slightly sweet with a hint of grains . overall a quite pleasant aroma . taste : light taste with a decent sweetness . the taste seemed to match the smell as it was n't too sweet and had a decent grain aftertaste . mouthfeel : slightly thick with perhaps a bit too much carbonation . drinkability : good beer ... not great , i liked it fine but thought it might have needed a bit more of a roasted taste . i would not go out of my way to find this but also would n't turn one down if offered again .
**this** brew is the ladera ranch entry into the backstreet brewing 'carpool experiment ' in which the three brewers we given matching quantities of fermentables , hops & spices , and the same white labs belgian yeast strain . this one **pours** **a** **deep** **copper** **capped** **with** **a** **dense** **collar** **of** **tan** **foam** **with** **outstanding** **clarity** . entry is smooth with a subdued level of carbonation allowing orange peel and the belgian yeast to shine . mid-taste begins with a deep malt presence combined with complex spiciness . the finish is dry and ping-pongs between the distinct yeast and malty spices . mouthfeel is full without chalkiness and finishes dry . without a doubt , my favorite of the three experimental beers .
**a** **couple** **days** with grecian wines **proved** **satisfactory** **enough** , however for the eve before the wedding of **yours** truly i was delighted to find some semblance of hops at the wine restaurant in fira , santorini in this finely crafted **ale** **.** **a** **deep** **amber** **hue** **with** **a** **modest** **haze** gives the impression of rich **pale** **ales** or english **mild** **ale** **.** **light** **lace** was a sight for sore **eyes** **after** looking for the same with their famed white wines and desert digestives . an british-like demeanor chases this beer from the early nose of yeast fruits , hearty caramel malts , and spicy hops until its earthy linger of lupulin , nutty grain , and mild attenuation in finish . apples , pecans , toffee , biscuit all weave into an ester-malty culmination that 's balanced by the earthy bitterness of grass and spice from noble english hops- slight fruity with orange zest and grapefruit carry a challenger hop character that might remind me of citrusy american hops . well melded sweetness takes the shape of mild ripe tobacco as the floral character of hops complement the bold malts . thirst quenching and satisfying , this was a great find on the greek isles .
**a** **-** **crystal** **clear** **golden** **orange** **body** with **a** **little** **bit** **of** **white** **head** **and** **lacing** s - sour , acidic , peaches , citrus and a little funk . pretty damn awesome smell t - pretty intense and complex taste that evolves as it warms up . sweet melon upfront with some nice acidic sourness as well . some funk throughout but stronger towards the end . definite citrus notes leaning more tends lemon . m - medium body with light carbonation a little dry almost like a cider . d - very good stuff . a little intense for most people but for the style not to bad . also very enjoyable and good to see the changes as it warms up .
on tap at the bel air location the other day . **the** **beer** **pours** **a** **honey** **amber** **color** **with** **pretty** **good** **head** **retention** **and** **lacing** . the nose is sweet and spicey , focusing on clove and brown sugar in abundance . given the fairly intense aroma profile , i was a bit surprised and disappointed by the modest amount of flavor i got on this moderately ( at most ) sweet frame . i thought it was still pretty nice beer , but given how it smelled , i just expected more . mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly smooth ( almost all the beers i sampled at duclaw were a bit under carbonated , which i 'm sure affected the mouthfeel ) , and drinkability is pretty decent nothing mind blowing here , but this was a decent enough beer , especially considering the low abv . i would n't mind seeing a bit more spice and hoppiness on the palate , but other than that , this was n't bad at all .
**this** **is** **a** **great** **belgian** **pale** **,** and is a bit surprising **.** **has** **a** **cloudy** **rust** **color** **with** **a** **head** that keeps itself a live for some time . smells surprised me the most , with a major citrus scent and some follow up of belgian yeast strains . it has the taste that i can really enjoy however , with just a bit of the hops and sweetness but major belgian yeast flavor mixed with a citrus flavor i love unibroue and their brews , and this is second in line to the trois pistols . re fermentation
one-off 22floz bottle review from notes taken the 8th of june 2007 . the label indicates that this was 'bottled conditioned in 2006 . **'** **appearance** **:** **the** **modest** **head** **develops** **holds** up **alright** **,** **and** **sticks** along the glass 's side . **murky** body is a **shade** **darker** than school **bus** **yellow-orange** . smell : a hop concoction of fruity esters ( pineapple and grapefruit ) and floral attributes ( a light touch of wild flower aroma ) taste/mouthfeel/drinkability : this will be done through a list of desribing words -- -chewy , tangy , mouthpuckering , full-bodied , tart citrus , grapefruit bitterness , and honey nectar . dunno if that simplifies things ... but for me it works . mighty tasty ! probably would go well with certain foods and smelly cheeses . smutty does n't dissappoint as it does a good job at brewing a dipa .
33cl bottle **,** **pours** **a** **crystal** **clear** **burnished** **orange** which flickers in **between** **apple** **juice** **ruby** **and** **sunset** **brilliance** **,** **three** **fingers** **of** **foam** **pile** on top and simmer down to a **thin** **layer** **that** **leaves** **gobs** **of** **lacing** down the glass . **lazy** spirals of bubbles surface to maintain a solid layer of fine **bubbles** **.** **spectacular** looking . nose is ripe with fruity esters , loads of apples , strawberries , a hint of spice . alcohol comes out initially and gives it a boozy feel but easily dies down as it warms to give the smell a warm fullness . first sip you 're struck by the thick boozy esters but after an acclimatization and a warming minute or two , the full glory of this beer comes out . appley esters , full graininess , light cloves almost peppery spiciness , grassy and lemony bitter finish , a thin candy sweetness winds its way . the best thing about this beer is the mouthfeel . thick without being syrupy , beautiful carbonation - it just rolls around your mouth . perhaps not a belgian ipa and perhaps a little on the boozy side , especially initially , but at 10.5 % we can be a little forgiving . this is a finely crafted beer that , despite my overall hesitancy with tripels , i would enjoy having regular access to .
my opinion is **unfortunately** **tainted** **because** of my love for all things bitter . with that said , i do n't know why there are a certain few that ca n't stand **this** beer . i would think it could harbor a mediocre review on style compatibility alone- this is an apa and tastes/drinks as such . i , of course , think that it 's the best thing in a can that is out there , and one of my favorite hoppy brews overall . if you like hops , then this will double the **size** **of** **your** **hop** **head** . sure it 's unbalanced , but that is the appeal of the apa- an overhopped ipa . am i right ? and to validate my opinion , i had this beer on a non-hyped recomendation of a liquor store owner on my visit to the carolina's- i 'd never even heard of it before then . so , hyped or not , from a one hop lover to the next , buy a six and enjoy .
**a-deep** **black/brown** **with** **a** **large** **dark** **tan** **head** **that** **reduced** **to** **a** **thin** **cap** **and** **left** **nice** **lace** s-spicy hop notes up front backed up by a healthy dose of roasted malt , chocolate and a hint of raisin t-roasted malt up front with backing notes of coffee , chocolate and dark fruit . touch of spicy/earthy hops . most prevalent in the after taste is the subtle zing of sour cherry . building dry finish . m-medium bodied with good lingering bitterness from the malt and hops . not as big and robust as some ris can be but it holds it 's own . d-plenty of flavour and not too heavy . for a ris a relatively easy drinker . a 10 % session ris ... .well ...

had a bottle of this yesterday at a family gathering . **not** a bad beer at **all** . in fact **if** was **pretty** **good** . **pours** **the** **standard** **cloudy** **,** **medium** **golden** **color** **of** all other wheat beers i have seen . has an initially **very** **nice** **thick** **white** **head** **that** **sticks** around for a bit , but not too long . left **some** **nice** lacing in my glass though . smells are primarily of citrus , perhaps a touch of lemon , some wheat/grains , and a bit of spice . not very strong aromas overall . tastes fairly sweet with citrus , lemon and some mild spiciness hitting the palate first , followed by some wheats and malts . moderate carbonation makes for a nice crisp mouthfeel . very easy to drink . now that i had one of these for free i think this may indeed be worth buying . a very good , solid offering here from the boston beer company indeed
**1** **liter** flip top 'growler ' acquired in trade with hophead22 ( thanks **poured** **a** **medium** **amber** **color** **with** **an** **averaged** **sized** **off** **white** **head** . aromas of floral hops , grains , citrus , and there 's something there i just could n't put my finger on . little spicey too . tastes of citrus , some caramel , and the same floralness .
**pours** **a** **clear** **,** **dark** **amber** **color** **with** **almost** **no** **head** **.** **leaves** **very** **little** **lacing** . aroma is of dark sweet fruit and a hint of coffee . taste starts out almost sugary sweet and is followed by roasted malts , sweet fruit ( raisin ) and some alcohol . seems a little thin and watery , but that may be due to the fact that i just had a dfh 90min . and this just seems thin compared to it .

**a** **:** **pours** **a** **nice** **black** **color** **,** same as the original . **not** **much** **head** **and** **little** **lacing** s : not quite overwhelming , but not exactly faint bourbon and oak up front . a little chocolate and coffee underneath t : nice vanilla and bourbon wash over your tongue on the way down . slight chocolate hiding underneath m : full bodied and smooth . light carbonation and a slight hoppiness d : better than regular boris . being aged it is a bit smoother than the original ( we tried the 2 side by side ) . enough bourbon to satisfy me and light enough for my friend to enjoy . great ba stout here guys . worth the drink ! do n't quote me as saying this is the best ever , but it could hang with a few of em .
**pours** **an** **attractive** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **moderate** **head** . the aroma has an orange ( corriander ? ) feel with a small hoppiness . slightly earthy . the flavor is much like the aroma . some orange and yeast spices , finishes with a bitter hop . this is a pretty good beer , but it 's really missing something for a tripel . might be better as a dubbel .
**i** was lucky enough to catch the brew master on **all** the reviews for **this** beer , he was great ! i came in from out of town and even on an off day he was more than happy to give me and my friends a tour and afterwards we sampled all his **available** **ales** . the olde jack **poured** **nutty** **brown** **with** **a** **slight** **head** on it . full bodied , strong and sweet . he hit right on the money with this brew . intensely bitter at first but was soon beaten by the malty sweetness . excellent mouthfeel and great finish .

**gold** **appearance** **,** **crystal** **clear** **.** head is light and without body , gone in 20 seconds . **practically** **no** lace to speak of . really have to work hard for an aroma , palest corn syrup . the flavor is somewhat better , shows some malted milk qualities with carbonation that works decently side-by-side . finishes with inadequate hops and a little too much residual sugar sweetness . mouthfeel and drinkability are decent , a throw -em back macro style of beer for a camping trip or tailgating .

bottle **:** **poured** **a** **deep** **black** **color** **ale** **with** **a** **huge** **foamy** **head** **with** **great** **retention** . aroma of bitter roasted malt is quite powerful . taste is dry , i would even say too dry for my own taste , with a long bitter finish and a strange yeast taste that does n't mix very well with the rest . body is above average and alcohol is well hidden . can not say i was overly impressed with that one and i ca n't see what everybody is raving about . well , i will go back to their blonde and brune which i enjoyed a great deal more .
**this** **beer** **tastes** **like** **vomit** . **no** really , it actually **tastes** **and** **smells** like fresh **vomit** . that might sound rather harsh , but it 's the truth . i struggled through one of these , hoping at some point my palet would adjust to something that i was missing , but no , it just kept tasting like actual **vomit** . i do n't really know what else to say , when a beer tastes this **terrible** the appearance and **texture** **do** **n't** really matter . epic failure .

**flying** **dog** **doggie** **style** , on tap at mellow mushroom , charlottesville , va , 01/11/09 . served in a traditional american pint glass . appearance **:** **comes** **a** **transparent** **orange** **amber** **with** **sparse** , infrequent carbonation.. **arrived** **without** **a** head , though there was **a** **thick** **sheen** **of** **snow** **atop** **with** **some** **thin** **,** **delicate** **solid** **sheets** **of** **lace** . the sheet-like nature of it all does n't remain long , but there 's still plenty of **sticky** **,** **clingy** **,** **stained** **glass-esque** **lacing** . aroma : very biscuity , crisp , caramelized malts and a handful of herbal hoppyness . simplistic , but pleasant . taste : very neutral , with herbal , lightly minty , faintly tobacco-y hops resting atop a sea of dry , well-attenuated , roasted malts . bitterness is mild to moderate . it 's just a largely mild , inoffensive , nondescript brew . mouthfeel : medium bodied , with a slight , dry , subtle crispness that results from a mild and fine-bubbled effervescence . drinkability : similar to the last brew i tried ( the brooklyn pennant ) , this one 's a straightforward , inoffensive , not-too-terribly flavorful pale ale . there 's nothing wrong with it , it 's just not terribly impressive or bold . the alcohol 's right though , and at mellow mushroom the price is always right , so i do n't regret buying it at all .
beer review from ba mag aug 2007 . released in 2002 , this was apparently australia 's first 100 percent certified **organic** **beer** and boasts that it is 'generously hopped . **'** **unfiltered** , we **opt** to decant carefully and allow it to **pour** **a** **bright** **,** **very** **clear** **pale** **golden** **brew** **topped** **with** **a** **rocky** **white** **foam** **head** **that** **shows** **great** **head** **retention** . pale malts , rhubarb and floral , fruity esters , with suggestions of caramel sweetness . incredibly smooth on the palate , surprisingly medium-bodied and round -- almost a bit chewy , with a kickass foundation of fresh pale malts . sweet , but not overboard , with toasty , caramel malts providing depth . the carbonation emerges from the body and provides a gentle crisp edge , with a semi-floral hop character and fruitiness that follows . residual caramel notes and a toasty sweet linger in the finish . by today 's standards , this leans more toward being a full and malt pale ale as opposed to an ipa ; but as it stands , it 's a tasty organic offering from down under -- it 's just not an ipa . not even close . more hops , please .
**cloying** **sweet** **cookie** **.** **last** **beer** of the night , bottle shared with george at the ginger man nyc . **oatmeal** **cookie** aroma along with the **roast** **coffee** , lots of sugar **dust** . **black** and lacey.carbonation is right there . average mouthfeel . chocolate finish and aftertaste .
**this** **beer** **is** **and** **was** **amazing** . i have never tasted a beer that was this fruitful . **usually** a beer **does** **n't** have a flavor that is this pronounced . the only way that i can relate this beer is to think of it as maraschino cherries . the beer also does not have a major aftertaste . but the aftertaste it does have is much like the overall taste .
**this** **is** **,** **indeed** **,** **an** **outstanding** **ipa** **.** **pours** **a** **burnt** **orange** **with** **a** **two** **inch** **off-white** **foam** **head** **.** smells enticingly like sweet citrus and gushing grapefruit , tropical pineapple/papaya , and a bit of pine . ooo ... . very nice aroma . taste is similarly nice . the malt/caramel is very understated , this is a hops showcase . bursting pine and sweet pink grapefruit , a touch of earthy pine bittering , and the nuances of tropical pineapple/papaya/exotic citrus carry through in the form of a lingering nuanced aftertaste . extremely quaffable and enjoyable . good mouthfeel , if a bit light ... could use maybe a touch more body .
**i** had this on tap at naja 's in redondo beach ( served in a pint , $ 7 **)** . **the** **beer** **was** **murky** **copper** **color** **with** **very** **little** **head** . the smell was very west coast hops , lots of grapefruit and some pine needle resin mixed together . the taste is aggressive with afore-mentioned hops while having a serious amount of malt thrown in for balance . this is comfortably a dipa , but it rides the line close to barley wine territory . the body is fairly thick making this seem a significant beer , easy for me to finish the pint but it forced some nursing .
served from a can , brought back from trip to the brewery in **wisconsin** **.** **color** **was** **cranberry** **pink** **,** **with** **a** **light** **pink** **foam** . smelled sweet , like blackberries ( like the label says ) . taste was sweet and fruity , did n't have much a of a beer taste at all . reminded me of drinking a cream soda ( the carbonation felt like a soda pop ) . if you do n't like typical grainy beer flavor , this would be a good one to try . i give it high marks because it is what it claims to be - fruity , flavored , and not masculine . no suprises , pretty much what i was expecting .
12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass . **a** **-** **cloudy** **,** **rich** **orange/amber** **appearance** . high level of carbonation with lots of perfect tiny bubbles . **great** **full** **,** **white** **head** . s - fruity & hoppy . very pleasant . t - sweet and citrusy at the front , bitter and crisp on the way down . really delicious but i do not care for the long and overly bitter aftertaste . overall an interesting and above average offering . m - carbonation from start to end - bubbly and crisp . full bodied and somewhat chewy . d - easy to reccomend and a pleasure to drink .
**a** **:** **crystal** **clear** **,** **no** **head** , no sedimate , just like all the others . s : corona meet heiny on the smallest level , then throw in some mich golden for good measure . essentially nothing . t : um ... lightest bit of hops , water , yeah ... m : feels like water , nothing on the finish d : there 's much better out there , but if it 's this or nothing , it 's your call but i 'll drink water .
**``** **a-** **amber** **gold** **with** a solid **two** **maybe** **even** **three** **finger** **head** **.** **''** **looks** **absolutely** **delicious** , i dare say it is one of the best looking beers i 've had . s- light citrus and hops . not a very strong aroma t-wow , the hops , citrus and pine blow out the taste buds , very tangy in taste , yet perfectly balanced , leaving a crisp dry taste to the palate . m-light and crisp feel with a nice tanginess thrown in the mix . d- could drink this all night , too bad i only have one more of this brew . notes : one of the best balanced and best tasting ipa 's i 've had to date . ipa fans you have to try this one .
**a** **tasty** brew courtesy **of** number1bum . cheers **josh** **appearance** **:** **an** **easy** pour from the can into my new shorts glass ( thanks stef ! ) , the beer is a **clean** **,** **clear** **golden** **bronze** **color** **.** there 's **plenty** **of** **white** **,** **foamy** **head** on this bad boy , at least an **inch** and **a** **half** **.** **the** **lacing** is **most** **impressive** **,** **heaps** **of** **thick** **sticky** **foam** **clinging** to the sides of the glass . smell : fresh and surprisingly bitter and hoppy with just a little bit of sweetness balancing everything out . taste : not as hoppy as the smell would indicate , but the hops are still there . the hops are a bit peppery and remind me of grapefruit that ai n't quite ripe yet . the bitterness really likes to hang on too , not really leaving a clean finish . mouthfeel : nice medium body , plenty of carbonation , pretty much what you would expect for the style . drinkability : not a bad drinking pale ale . it has some nice hops to it , and a sessionable abv . this beer is really at home on a cool summer night . i 'd definitely recommend it , thanks again josh
**bb** 30/11/2008 , served **chilled** **in** **a** **pilsner** glass **.** **a** **:** **pours** **a** **dark** **straw** **hue** **,** lively carbonation full of **tiny** **bubbles** **,** **topped** **with** **a** **cottony** **white** **foamy** **head** **with** **ok** **retention** **.** s : a pretty decent level of lager-maltiness comes before a mildly floral-hoppy note and the decent sweet starfruity/lemony note of a well-lagered beer , while a swirl wakes up a mildly doughy touch . alas , apart from these the aroma has nothing else to show . t : rather tart-fruity upfront , a bit like starfruits , with a syrupy touch of malts , then being taken over by a rich flavour of bitter-sweet , honey-ish and faintly peanut-y lager malts that has a semi-chewy toasty element to it . finish is decently bitter-sweet , added with a touch of dried grass in the hop bitterness . m & d : quite refreshing , somewhat lacking the weight for a 6 % abv . beer and also a tad watery in the finish , but overall easy drinking . imo , this beer needs a slightly heavier maltiness for a decent gravity , but the soothing aftertaste of bitter-sweet hops seems to elevate the whole performance a bit . not bad , albeit simplistic .
**served** **in** **a** **brandy** **snifter** **.** **murky** **chestnut** **colored** **with** **an** **inch** **high** **light** **brown** **thick** **head** **that** **slowly** **recedes** **leaving** **a** **ring** of large **bubbles** around the inside edges of the glass . inviting and rich aroma of baked rhubarb , honey , ripe fruit and hoppy bitters . big flavor of fig and prune , some tangy cherry . balance of caramel and hops upfront . some molasses and roasty malt , punctuated by alcohol warmth , finishes with a flourish of hops . mildly sweet . more prune in the finish . full mouthfeel , not too carbonated , thick . just this side of syrupy . pretty drinkable , but it 's a sipper with all that vapor rising up .
thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle **.** **pours** **a** **murky** **orangish-brown** **color** **with** **a** **white** **head** **.** the aroma is tart lemons . the flavor is tart lemons with some oak-aged character . the beer finishes very dry . medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation .
**canary** **gold** **with** **suspended** **yeasties** . served way too cold ; warmed to room temperature over an hour or so . slow upward-streaming **bubbles** **.** **modest** **head** **,** **fantastic** **lace** . nose is full of cracked pepper and tart and spicy yeast phenols . buttered bread lurks underneath . powdery malt . open yeast packets . taste is much better than nose , fulfilling many requirements of the style ; dry , tart , semi-sweet , with a lingering bitterness . coriander , near-buttery malts . grain flavor lingers . love this beer except for the lingering nutrisweet flavor that pops in and out . goes down pretty well , though there is a slight orange-rind astringency i do n't particularly care for . drinks well - you could stick with this one your meal and beyond .
on tap at the brewpub - december 27 , 2010 **.** **pours** **a** **dark** **brown** **color** **with** **a** **good** **tan** **head** **that** **leaves** **behind** **a** **bit** **of** **lacing** and sticks around for awhile . the nose is really nice and chocolatey . really love the level they 've used . under that , a bit of roasted malt but this was mostly about the chocolate . the taste is n't quite as nice , though the chocolate notes really still stand out . the feel was quite nice with a full body . pretty viscous for what it is . drinks quite well . i 'm a big fan .
**poured** **a** **ruddy** **brown** **,** **no** **haze** **at** **all** **.** **off-white** **head** **formed** **and** **very** **slowly** **receded** **to** **lace** . smell is chocolate and caramel malts , hint of noble hops . malty sweetness is very prevalent . the taste hits with chocolate malts at the beginning , then a bit of sweetness , and fades with a decent noble hop finish . something is n't quite right with the hops , but i can not put my finger on it . it is n't unpleasant , it 's disconcerting ; it 's not right , but it is n't dead wrong , either . just odd . mouthfeel is smooth with a bit of dryness in the finish . very drinkable . will certainly wash down the dryest of chimichangas .
**poured** from a 12 ounce bottle into a chimay goblet . best by date 09-24-12 . **appearance** **:** **pours** **an** **opaque** **golden** **orange** **with** **a** **1/4** **finger** **foamy** **white** **head** **which** **dissipates** **almost** **instantly** **.** **no** **lacing** at all . smell : quite sweet with banana , yeast and citrus dominating with just a hint of phenols . taste : yeast and malt up front followed by a burst of banana and citrus esters in the middle then finishes with malt and dry phenols . aftertaste is a mixture of sour citrus and phenols . the high alcohol is well hidden by the tremendous flavor of the beer . mouthfeel : medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation . the carbonation bursts through from the get go . drinkability : excellent drinkability . you do n't really notice the alcohol at all so this one could very well sneak up on you . overall : excellent beer overall . buy it if you see it . it is one i thoroughly enjoyed .
**poured** from the **bottle** **a** **clear** **amber** **gold** **with** **a** **pencil-thin** **white** **head** **.** aroma of light malts and a side order of skunk . taste is pretty comparable to most bmcs on the market . slightly sweet with the malts and honey . light mouthfeel , crisp , and moderately carbonated . quite drinkable and all that , but nothing real special .
**pours** **a** **hazy** **yellow** **color** **with** **a** **big** **white** **head** . in the aroma , yeasty and candy sugar . in the taste , candy sugar , yeast , and a small hop . a small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel , with a lightly dry candy sugar in the aftertaste . a nice small bitterness and hop in a basic blonde .
**a** **deep** **golden** **color** **pour** **,** **nice** **sustained** **head** **of** **about** **a** **1/2** **finger** . smell of citrus hops with some cherry , i think it was . not very strong , but consistent . taste was a good punch of hops , followed by a semi-sweetness of malt , some grapefruit and pear . mouthfeel was a bit creamy or buttery , kinda weird . i thought it would coat a bit , but it finished fairly crisp . good drinking : listed as seasonal .
**appearance** **:** **pours** **a** **clear** **copper** **color** **with** **a** **fizzy** **head** **that** **quickly** **disappears** **to** **a** **ringlet** and milky way **;** **virtually** **no** **lacing** smell : vague odor of caramel malt and noble hops , but very vague taste : starts out rather toasty and the sweet malt builds into the finish ; the finish is dry and chalky with some residual sweetness mouthfeel : medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation drinkability : not offensive but nothing special
**appearance** **:** **pours** **a** **slightly** **murky** **ice** **tea** **brown** **color** **with** **a** **frothy** **head** **and** **some** **lacing** smell : malted milk chocolate and hazelnuts ; rather bready taste : starts with a very clean malty base which turns a bit earthy and coarse in the aftertaste mouthfeel : very smooth but a tad below medium bodied ; moderate carbonation drinkability : a very pleasant scottish that is marked down a bit for its mediocre finish
**poured** from a bottle into a pint glass . came out with **a** **nice** **clean** **clear** **look** **with** **a** **good** **size** **head** that did not last long . it has little **to** **no** **lacing** . was at first really smooth with a slightly bitter finish . it also has some good carbonation . the smell was great and probably was my favorite part of this beer . all around good beer .
**so** maybe waiting to try my first ten fidy on te hottest day of the year in massachusetts was **n't** the best way to experience this beer . that being said , if this beer is as good in the dead of winter as it was tonight , that **means** **something** . **it** **pours** **black** **,** **with** **a** **chocolate** **head** . malty , bitter , chocolate smell . not overpowering but impressive . nicely balanced beer that definitely lives up to the hype still ca n't believe this beer comes out of a can , i will be picking more up soon .
**the** **beer** **looks** **great** **--** **a** **nice** **,** **deep** **brown** **with** **a** **fine** **head** . the aroma screams dunkelweizen ; the banana , clove , and sweet malt notes are all at the fore . a sip of this beer , however , reveals some big problems . the main one is the level of sweetness . to be sure , german wheat beers typically have a sweet , fruity element to them . but franconia winter wheat has a heavy , overwhelming sweetness that sets into the tongue and obscures its other facets . it is n't that the beer is n't 'to style ' -- i do n't really care about that -- but rather that it has none of the balance and craftsmanship that i detect in franconia 's three flagship brews . the modest hop bitterness -- which , in a well-made beer , would suffice -- here collapse under the unwieldy syrupy-sweet mess . those last four ounces were tough to finish . i want to be a fan of every beer from this brewery ; my heart is open , so to speak . that 's probably why i was so disappointed . franconia can do better than this , and in a year 's time , i 'll revisit this beer to see if any improvements were made .
**clown** shoes blaecorn unidragon 22 oz bottle into snifter **pour** **is** **opaque** **with** **a** **massive** **mocha** **colored** **head** that took its time to sink into **a** **wisp** **atop** **.** **some** **nice** **lacing** around the sides of the glass . aroma has hints of licorice , brown sugar and molasses with enough espresso and cocoa to go around . some pine-like hops balance things out nicely . nicely hopped , somewhat agressive with lots of pine and some grapefruit rind . coffee and dark chocolate are present in the flavor with some anise lingering about . no trace of the 12.5 % abv which is very surprising . excellent offering . reminds me a bit of goose island 's nighstalker with the abundant hopping . ca n't believe it clocks in at 12.5 % abv , hardly a trace of it in the flavor . well done .
**pours** **yellow** **gold** **,** with a **slightly** **amber** **hue** **and** **a** **white** **,** **soda** **like** **head** . floral pine and a little grassy.not alot there , but pretty decent . a bit grainy , fairly dry , some bitterness on the back of the tongue . a bit of skunky flavor . light bodied and pretty dang drinkable . more suitable for summer , but good enough whenever .
picked this up over christmas . have n't gotten around to drinking it till now , in **march** **.** **absolutely** **lovely** **looking** **beer** . **pours** **out** **a** **clear** **walnut** **color** **with** **a** **good** **finger** **of** **foam** **topping** **it** **,** **frothy** **and** **lasting** . smells pleasantly malty with nice notes of vanilla . extreme vanilla-bean flavor , overwhelming everything else . i consider myself a fan of vanilla . but this is just too overwhelmingly vanilla . no subtlety , no craft such promise , such failure . i ended up pouring about half of the beer down the drain .
22oz bottle into a snifter . this was an extra from a kind trader , and something i 've never tried before . **the** **beer** **pours** **a** **black** **with** **off-white** **head** . there are touches of brown and red in the mix . **the** **head** **quickly** **subsides** and does **n't** **leave** **much** **lace** . the beer smells strongly of bakers chocolate with a touch of coffee and even some dark fruit . there 's also some noticeable booze , but it 's nothing horrible . i 'm also getting a touch of sourness , but this is n't infected - more of an acidity from the roast . the taste is really strong roast with some nuanced complimentary flavors and a bit of booze . there 's a nice touch of hop bitterness as well . but the focus is on the chocolate and coffee flavors , backed up with a sweet malt base . there are some notes of fig and prune , plus some licorice that give this depth the beer has a thick body and low carb , resuling in it coming across as a touch syrupy . there is some lingering roast in the finish and some sweetness . this beer is decent and enjoyable , but southern tier choklat blows it out of the water .
received in trade with cooperrip thanks again . bottle states limited spring 2006 release served a bit below room right into **a** **nonic** **.** **tan** **head** **rose** **and** **fell** and lingers on the surface . the body is **black** **oily** and **completely** **opaque** **.** smells is robust , salty , smoky , earthy , maybe some brown sugar , dirty coffee hints of caramel and that slight anise character typical in some ris , but subtle and perfectly executed . taste is big , chewy , meaty , yet immediately approachable . i get an excellent roasted flavor , colored by a nutty character that makes it sort of pop in my mouth . bitterness is perfectly balanced definitely not as aggressive as some , but provides tasteful ballast . mouthfeel is wonderful , well balanced , surly and big , yet so tasty and easy to drink . this great offering starts aromatic and tasty and ends in very welcome alcohol warmth . i am very pleased to have had this wanderful brew . great companion on a cold night , a simply great brew from a great brewery . god i wish i could get a case and do as they suggest
12 oz bottle . thanks to splitgrin for hooking me up with this one . enjoyed mostly at approx . cellar temp..do n't even attempt to drink this straight out of the fridge . the first couple sips i had were too cold for this to show it 's true character . **pours** **a** **very** **dark** **,** **muddy** **reddish-brown..beige** **head** . oak , vanilla & burnt cocoa aromas surge from the glass . flavor has it 's share of dark chocolate ( a ton of it actually ) , vanilla , and coffee..with the noticeable oaky bourbon flair of course . the alcohol is not shy in this brew , and you can definitely pick it up with every sip . medium-bodied..could be a bit more thick and not hurt my feelings much . if you 're a sucker for dark chocolate and/or like bourbon-aged beers , then you need to find this somewhere .
**pours** **dark** **amber** **with** **almost** **white** **head** . nose is caramel sweet , with a suggestion of black tea aromas . palate is caramelly sweet but not heavily sweet , and light in flavors of cinnamon , nutmeg , and overall malty sweetness . this is a very light version of a winter beer , as far as winter beers go , normally . however , i think this wheat lager was clearly intended to be this way . easy drinking .
thanks **goes** out to ybnorml for **this** **brew** **.** **pours** **a** **nice** **black** **color** **,** **nice** **carbonation** **,** **nice** **little** **fizzy** **light** **tan** **head** **,** **with** **some** **nice** **sticky** **lacing** to follow . the nose is malty , with lots of chocolate , caramel . the taste is slightly sweet , malty , with a good dose of chocolate , slight toffee , caramel . medium body . drinkable , another tasty brew from fd .
**when** i began homebrewing about 15 years ago , i needed bottles . bass was my beer of choice to accomplish the mission . no need to buy bottles with **nothing** in them , right **light** **honey/caramel** **,** **orange-yellow** **color** **.** **head** is **very** **dense** **,** very thick , and keeps going until the end of the beer . smell is a nice blend of sweet and hop-sharp with the hops edging out by a bit . taste was a bit mild-mannered . some creamy sweetness that moves more towards hop toward the end . malt flavors were mild and the hops stepped out a bit more . bordering on thin and low carbonation . i 'll give the drinkability just over average , because it 's not unpleasant , nor bad , just not awesome .
**an** **orange** **tea** **colored** **brew** **with** **a** **goodly** **foamy** **head** **and** **decent** **bits** **of** **lacing** throughout . a fairly unique aroma of barbeque malt and piney hops , very palatable blend . the taste is a nice mellow mouthful of creamy malt and earthy hops , again , nicely and uniquely blended with a tasteful hint of alcohol at only 5.5 % . some deep toffee tones are there as well , almost butterscotch sweet . very drinkable , meekly carbonated but very nice body . a dry bitter finish follows . i like this one and will recommend to all

**pous** **out** of the rocket widget bottle with a vengance . **a** **lovely** **dark** **,** **dark** **brown** **head** **,** that **lovely** smell that is **guiness** . it really is an old friend . strange to review it really 'cause i'be been drinking it for 30 years . still sometimes the review is simply a way of expressing oneself . from the bitter to the coffee ; with that creamy smooth feel in the mouth . why can some macros do it and others ca n't ? i have often said aftertaste is my big thing . well , guinness has good aftertaste . guinness draught is one of the reliable ones when it comes to beer . in those airport bars , chain hotels , etc . you can always be sure with this brew . there may be better beers out there but never forget your old friend or you 'll grow old alone .

4/13/2005 $ 7.99 750 ml 10.00 % production date 11-23-2004 **pours** **a** **dark** **brown** **with** **hints** of red intermingled . fine bubbles line the glass and lead **to** **a** **medium** **tan/white** **head** **that** **settles** **rapidly** **leaving** **no** **lace** . mildly piquant with scents of ripe fig and tropical fruits . an assertive sweetness from candied sugar presents itself as well , slightly masking a healthy dose of alcohol . rich ripe fruit swirls on the tongue , brining with it plum , cherry and a touch of sweetness . fairly reminiscent of quelque chose , but with a touch more alcohol presence . mouthfeel is viscous and sticky , with a slight mouth puckering tartness in the finish . this is an excellent offering yet again from unibroue . alcohol is expertly masked , making this deceptively drinkable .
**a** **nice** showing from **the** **get** **go** **here** **.** **super** **fluffy** **beige** **head** **with** **gloriously** **artistic** **lacing-hey** **nice** **legs** on this one eh ! deep in the nose with an over-abundance of malt syrup and caramalized pear . the mouthfeel continues in the malt syrup direction , yet proves to be more enjoyably rich than flabby . more malt and sweet pear in the mouth . man this is a real fun beer to warm up to ! the concentration of malt , and the subtle entrance of fruit in the way of roasted pear , tart cherry and red berry make for a complex taste experience . pretty to the end with washes of vanilla and bittersweet hop . i 'd love to be on this pirate ship-cept during a storm maybe ! finishes moderately candied and warm-check your reviews for spelling to see if your not quite buzzed and beginning to make errors

22oz bottle into tulip pint . a - **pours** **a** **clear** **,** **but** **fairly** **dark** **amber** **with** **an** **off-white** **head** **that** **has** **fair** **retention** and some light rising carbonation . s - very strong bread upfront with some faint hop bitterness to the finish . t - more fresh baked bread with some very lightly roasted malt as well as more light almost herbal hop bitterness in the finish . m - medium to full body , with good carbonation . d - a nice change of pace with a very bready backing and unique flavor , though still very approachable and easy to enjoy . this is my first of this style , though i was able to pick up the tea-like hop flavor mentioned in the style description .
**being** a relative rookie when it comes to imperial **ipa** and **quality** beer in general , i ca n't help but think that maybe **maharaja** has **spoiled** **me** **.** **looks** **beautiful** served on draft in a small brandy snifter **.** **looks** **like** a **burnt** orange to me . the smell is amazing - a wonderful combination of citrus hops and some other fruity sweetness that i ca n't really place . the taste is probably even better than the smell . it 's a perfect balance of hops and malt i lack the beer vocab to truly do maharaja justice , but i 'll just say it 's a fantastic beer and the best ipa i 've ever had to date . my only complaint is that i did n't discover this beer years ago . i could drink way too many of these .
my boss picked this up for me on a revent trip to vermont . thanks for the surprise brock ! poured into **a** **pint** **glass** **.** **pours** **without** **a** **head** **.** **just** **a** **brownish** **colored** **beer** with a little bit of **a** **reddish** **hue** to it . the aroma is a little bit nutty with a hint of cocoa . pretty enjoyable to sniff this guy . the flavor is a little bit weaker though , a slight nuttiness with some fruitiness to round it out . a little bit of metallic hops in the background . the carbonation is soft on this one with a nice light body . overall easy to enjoy and very drinkable . glad to have tried this .
**produces** **a** **great** **three** **finger** **sized** **crown** **of** **light** **tan** **cranium** **that** **dwindles** down and **stays** about **a** **finger** thick through the whole serving in a chimay **chalice** **.** **awesome** **lacing** , and has **a** **dark** **ruby** **reddish** **copper** **colored** **body** that is **pretty** **hazy** . the aroma is yeasty and grape upfront , then floral , sweet molasses and fig . this does finish up with an herbal/metallic characteristic . upfront in the taste are figs and cherry , and the honey is detectable . this beer also reminds me of a german lebkuchen as well . this has feelings of a chewy/sticky/warming appeal . local 2 has all the traits to make it a great beer in its style category .
12 oz . bottle with no freshness date **;** **the** cap states this is a solar powered brewery . the **ale** **poured** **a** **yellow** **,** **goldish** **color** **with** **a** **very** **slight** **haze** **.** **the** head was nice and **white** **,** **about** **1/4** **inch** **.** it **dissipated** **rather** **quickly** **leaving** **very** **little** **lacing** . it has a looks a lot like anchor liberty ale . a very fruity , tangerine like odor gave the impression of beer freshness the initial taste is of slight bitterness and carbonation followed by a fruity backbone . it appearance gives one the impression that this may be a light pale ale version ; it is not . it is rather substantial in flavor . it is little too carbonated for me , though the sweet aftertaste on the tongue is welcoming this one is better than i thought and more flavorful . the ale was quite expensive and really should have a freshness date . at 5.5 abv and its balanced flavor , it would make a decent session ale .
bonus bottle from kplynch..thanks **bro** **pours** **dark** **gold** **with** **a** **heavy** **chill** **haze** **,** **and** **a** **half-inch** **head** **of** **white** **foam** **.** **retention** is moderate and **a** **few** **streaks** **of** **lacework** appear for the duration . aromatics are a blend of biscuity malt , pine sap , citrus fruit , and pineapple skin . not incredibly pungent or floral , but square on and crisp for a standard ipa . medium bodied , drying and minerally crisp . dried citrus fruits and spruce on the pallet . some lightly toasted malt follows through and a smidge of warming alcohol . drying and firmly bitter with a chaulky nod . finishes with pineapple skins , biscuit malt , and mild grapefruit with apricots . tasty enough , and this ones seeming pretty fresh . i 'd have another one
cottrell **'old** **yankee** **ale** ' bottle pour into **a** **pint** **glass** **.** **appearance-** **cloudy** **brown** **pour** **with** **a** **thick** **two-finger** **head** **.** **fantastic** **head** **retention** **.** little visible carbonation and the **translucency** **smell-** not especially strong but you can really smell tones of malt , with a roasted , nutty flavor as a pleasant after taste . taste- the taste is my favorite part of this beer . the medium body allows you appreciate the balanced malty taste that finishes with a well proportioned , hoppy bite drinkability- i would definitely buy this beer again . the well balanced taste combined with medium carbonation and body create a delicious experience that you can see traced down your glass the entire time you drink it thanks to a think , **sticky** lace .
**nerax** **04** **one** **of** **the** **few** **cloudy** **ones** **.** **a** **hazy** **amber** **swirls** under **a** **nice** **high** **rounded** **head** . the sour scent from the citrusy orangey hops rises up from the fruity appley malt base . lots of orange popping up all over this one . the juicy finish keeps you from getting too dry .
**a-** **very** **dark** **read** **,** **almost** **no** **head** **and** **minimal** **lacing** . s - bready , some hops , dense fruit t - carmel , solid malt base , booze , washed over with pretty decent hop flavor . m - carbonation could be higher , as well as possibly a thicker body . maybe appropriate for style , it 's just my opinion . d - had my ups and downs with shark bite . loved it , then hated it . last two attempts were nasty . the only time i liked it was on tap . i thought this larger version might be the ticket . while it is bigger , boozier and hoppier , it is still flatter than i like and not nearly as carbonated . glad to try , though .
my buddy brought this back from a trip with his brother down south . i enjoyed it a lot even though i am **not** a **regular** **stout** **drinker** **.** **a** **-** **huge** **tan** **creamy** **head** on top of a super **black** **viscous** **liquid** . s - lots of roasted malt - coffee , chocolate , some caramel . some bourbon and oak in the back of my nose . t - a lot of bourbon up front with coffee bitterness on swallow - the bourbon completely overwhelmed any more subtle flavors on the first sip . as you adjust to the bourbon , the roasted malt flavors appear . m - thin with high carbonation - probably my least favorite part of the beer d- nice sipping beer . i picture drinking this on a warm summer evening at a pig roast eating pulled pork . the bourbon finish is tasteful , the burnt faint background brings depth to the beer . very enjoyable beer .
**pours** **a** **straw** **colored** **,** **hazy** **golden** **yellow** **with** **a** **vibrant** **foamy** **white** **head** **of** **big** **carbonation** **quickly** **dissipating** **leaving** **little** **lacing** in the glass . the fresh , pleasant hop aroma wafts from the glass featuring floral scents and citrus zest . also a hint of straw or grass , and just a touch earthy . big floral hops , wheat & yeast , perhaps just a hint of pepper , and lemon or similar citrus flavor . generous carbonation , light to medium bodied , and a great palate . this is a great beer for everyone . enough flavor for the true beer lover , but no so aggressive it turns away the novice . also , extremely easy to drink a few
**a** **-** **cloudy** **orange** **straw** **with** **2** **fingers** **of** **white** **head** and some yeast s - belgian yeast with citrus notes some funk and some spice t - belgian spices with lemon peel m - medium body with medium carbonation d - pretty good but there are other saisons that i would reach for first but a pretty decent example
**not** **a** **great** **fan** **of** the style itself but it delivers well on the stone taste you get in all of the brewery 's **beers** . it 's a little too hoppy to be considered a straight belgian strong but a great california style **clone** **of** the style . would recommend . this has turned into one of my favorite beers and is also very reasonably priced . i will be bumping up some of my numbers .
**pours** **a** **deep** **amber** **,** **with** **a** **tan** **head** **that** **quickly** **vanishes** . aroma was mostly of sweet malts , with hint of vanilla and some spice the taste is a pretty balanced one . sweet malts stand out . a bit of a vanilla taste as well . a very slight bitterness rounds everything off . very well balanced . extremely drinkable . winter solstice goes down smooth and easy . ready for another one .
2010 bottle , served cool in a st . b goblet . **a** **casual** **pour** **yielded** **a** **finger** **of** **light** **beige** **head** **situated** **atop** **a** **cloudy** **brown** **liquid** **the** **color** **of** **cider** in the fall **.** **the** **head** **faded** **fast** **leaving** **little** **to** **no** **lacing** . the aroma was rich with sweet malt , candied dark fruit and an earthiness that invoked images of being outdoors in a forest . the taste followed the nose closely - figs and plums , sugary sweet malts and a slight spiciness with a light alcohol finish . the mouthfeel was pleasant . it was full bodied , with medium ( but pronounced ) carbonation . overall it was a very satisfying beer to sit and slowly enjoy .
**a** **:** **dark** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **thin** **cream** **colored** **head** **s** : lots of rye bread , caramel , a little wet blanket and some black peppercorns t : caramel malt and a slight rye flavor followed by a lot of peppercorn heat . the heat grew after the finish and was really unexpected . i can honestly say i 've never had another beer like this .
thanks to natasharai for giving me an opportunity to try **this** **huge** **beer** **a** **:** **almost** **a** **finger** **of** **tan** **head** **with** a very **aggressive** **pour** **.** **pitch** **black** **with** **light** **brown** **only** **visible** in the **light** **.** **some** **retention** **but** **no** **lacing** . s : coffee beans , bitter chocolate , oatmeal , and toasty notes . t/m : huge espresso flavors -- like drinking a starbucks doubleshot . super viscous mouthfeel and low carbonation . silky smooth to boot . more coffee . a burnt characteristic really comes out as the beer warms . did i mention coffee d : a great sipper , but also incredibly drinkable for such a huge mouthfeel and flavor . very tasty
received as part of april shipment of my beer of the month club . serving glass : poured from bottle into nonic imperial pint **.** **appearance** **:** **slightly** **hazy** **reddish** **amber** **with** **very** **thin** **head** **.** smell : very mild malt smell , kind of english . where is the hop smell taste : light english malts with nice hop presence that leaves a grapefruit bitter aftertaste that slowly builds . for an ipa , it really is n't all that bitter - more balanced . feel : low carbonation and relatively light body . dry finish . once again , very english . drinkability : pleasant , easy drinking ale . nothing stands out too much , but i like it and could easily enjoy another . this is an english ipa , not an american ipa . it amazes me how many beers have been incorrectly categorized .
**pale** **golden** **very** **clear** **brew** with lots of **carbonation** **,** **off** **white** **head** with large **bubbles** among **smaller** **ones** **,** **decent** **retention** **and** **good** **lace** . very faint in the nose , some grass and hay but very faint . some spiced alcohol but you really got to look for it to notice . taste is similar to smell but the grass presence is much stronger , decent hop/malt balance . almost lacking any kind of aftertaste save for a weak hop flavor . medium fullness of body , leave a thin coat in your mouth . overall an ok beer , probably not something i 'll buy again but it was drinkable .
**pours** **fairly** **dark** **,** **clear** **burgundy** **color** **with** **a** **nice** **tan** **head** . aroma is filled with earthy , nutty , malty goodness . taste is similar - roasted notes , malty sweetness and just a touch of hops . this beer is light to medium in body with very low carbonation , low bitterness , and that makes it very drinkable . mouthfeel is pleasant this beer reminds me of scotland and great session beers of that country . at 5 % i personally think it 's too high to be a session beer , but it is still very drinkable and enjoyable . i think it 's very , very good .
**appearance** **:** **golden** **honey** . slightly orange . it 's a little opaque . it has **a** **weak** **head** **with** **minimal** **retention** . smell : a huge dose of bread pale malts . there is a huge blast of very citric hops taste : wow . this taste great . it has a good blend of cocoa malts . very bitter piney hops . slight tropical fruit sweetness . very bitter finish . mouthfeel : medium bodied with a chalky finish . drinkability : good but not quite as enjoyable as the pliny the elder which she had before .
2010 bottle thanks to mike . thanks mike ! 09 and 10 **bottles** **.** **pours** **pitch** **black** **with** **tan** **head** . aroma is coffee , chocolate , and dark fruit . the 09 had more toffee caramel and butterscotch notes . the 10 had more malt roastiness and hops . heavy mouthfeel . flavors followed the nose with both bottles . there were complex layers of roast , chocolate , caramel , and molasses . the toffee caramel flavors were more pronounced in the 1 year aged bottle . that 's why i preferred the aged bottle more . both excellent beers . it reminded me a lot of cigar city marshal zhukov 's imperial stout . great beer .
**a-clear** **,** **light** **copper** **hued** **with** **a** **medium** **off-white** **head** **that** **hung** **on** **and** **left** **decent** **lacing** behind . s-sweet malt blending well with a fairly pungent peppery hop aroma . t-good solid peppery hop flavour up front . this is balanced well with an ample dose of sweet caramel malt . a well balanced and flavourful apa . m-medium-light body , just a tad thin . hop bitterness lasts through the pint . d-a solid beer , the second best beer of the night here ... .and the best on the regular line up . this one easily out performs the house ipa .
**a** : poured **into** **a** **tall** **pilsner** glass , it yields **a** **clear** **,** **light** **amber** **body** with **a** big **,** **airy** **,** **off-white** **head** **that** **disappears** **quickly** . s : not sure what that smell is -- first thing that comes to mind is corn syrup and maybe sweet malt ; no , make that over-sweet malt . t : bland and non-offensive at first . like the nose , it 's sweet -- molasses , corn syrup and maybe some caramel malt . a slight metallic aftertaste appears deep at the end of the sip , but mainly this is all about sweetness . m : light in body , slightly slick in feel . d : like i said above , the first few sips were n't so bad . towards the end , however , it became a chore to drink this overly sweet beer and eventually i drained the last few ounces . notes : a bud light-drinking neighbor brought this over , knowing i like 'microbrews . ' i suppose coors deserves kudos for being able to convince some folks that this fits the bill as a craft-brewed beer . it clearly is not . funny thing is , about 15 years ago , i would sometimes get this in pitchers at certain bars , as it was ( 1 ) darker than your average macro lager ; and ( 2 ) relatively cheap . back then i thought it was n't half bad for what it was . either my tastes have evolved or this brew has gotten significantly worse , because nowadays i am not able to drink this .
**bass** **,** bass , wir brauchen bass , bass ' this beer is **n't** bad . yeah , i can definately see diggin ' this beer . hoppy by american standards it ai n't , but in terms of british beer i 've had , the hops really shine through on top opf the hops , the toffee qualities of the malt really shine though . a yummy beer , all-in-all . i 'd have it again . ideally next time on an engine .
**for** the first time i purchased a growler . have tried a number of the big horn **beers** in the past and they are certainly drinkable . the beer certainly fits the name **well** **and** **the** **color** **of** **this** beer is **very** **red** for a standard **ipa** **.** **had** **a** **full** **white** **head** **that** **had** **good** **staying** power for having been served in a growler . citrus notes and some acidity are definitely noticeable in the beer . the balance seems off as well since the hops over power the malt to a great extent . not a bad session beer as on a subsequent tasting had a pitcher during a game and noticed all the same things . taste and mouthfeel carry the beer with the hops being the main focus .
**came** **to** **me** **a** **pale** **golden** **color** **with** **a** **thin** **white** **lace** . smell was buttery sort of ringwood aroma ( do they use ringwood ? ) and some rotten lemon . not terribly appealing taste had a buttery toffee ringwood flavor ( again , do they use ringwood ? sure seems like it ) , some lemon that just was n't right ( like i said in the smell , like it was rotten , who knows ) , and a soggy wheat sort of flavor . i did not enjoy it at all . mouthfeel was medium bodied , adequately carbonated . i really disliked this brew . this is very rare for me , but i actually could not finish the pint .
**pours** **an** **amber** **with** **an** **orange** **hue** **.** **two** **inch** **white** **head** **fades** **quickly** **.** **very** **little** **lacing** . smells like bread , not much else . taste some sweet malt , and grass . not much better than a macro . lighter body with lots of carbonation . not a lot of flavor but this is a refreshing beer . i have no problem drinking these , i just would n't pursue it .
**pours** **a** **clear** **golden** **orange** **color** **with** **golden** **mango** **colored** **hues** **when** held to a light **source** **and** **a** **thin** **white** **foam** **head** **that** **quickly** **settles** into **a** **thin** **ring** . not much in the way **of** lacing . spicy aroma with hints of cinnamon and brown sugar along with hints of crisp light fruit , pepper , hops and caramel malt . this beer smells more like a marzen to me . softly carbonated up front with a strong spicy character that gives way to a malty center and long spicy dry finish . hints of caramel malt , pepper , light fruit , cinnamon and brown sugar . it kind of tastes like a watered down belgian interpretation of an oktoberfest/marzen .
**this** **trappist** was **not** quite as **dark** as its belgian **trappist** **counterparts** . however , do n't judge by that . it is a sweet , extremely **smooth** **,** **and** **delicate** beer . it gets better as is warms , and is a beer best drank after a meal , when you can just relax with it **.** **the** **head** was not anything to particularly write home about ( i do own a goblet glass for these specialties ) . however , the caramel-coffee smell was very savory , and hard to put down after a drink . it is a strong beer , but the sweetness of it masks the alcohol content nicely . personally , i think it is the best out of the trappist breweries , and is not overly expensive .
on tap at **the** **dfh** **brew** **pub** **.** **pours** **pale** **straw** **hue** **with** **a** **thin** **white** **head** . very fruity , malty aroma has a hint of hops . light-medium , crisp body . light , pleasant hops are balanced on the palate by biscuit malt and lemon fruit . very pleasant , light session beer .
**this** **one** **pours** **a** **dark** **mahogany** **with** **ruby** **hints** **,** **and** **a** **light** **tan** **head** . very light on the smell , hints of chocolate and roasted malt . creamy cocoa and coffee are at the front of the flavor . roasted grain and a mellow nut flavor back it up , with a hint of hop on the finish . somewhat light , but creamy at the same time , this is a difficult one to try to describe . carbonation is fairly robust . overall this is one of my favorite brews from new belgium . i 'm not a fan of quite a few of their beers , but this one is always a pleasant drinker .
**dirty** **dick** 's is very much what i expected . **a** **light** **golden** **brown** **pour** with a malty , musty aroma . signature , classic english malt flavor with a full , bitter finish . toffee and a hint of caramel as well . an easy drinking ale with moderate carbonation . would make a great session brew for most , though i prefer hoppier ales to this style . all in all a quality ale , and very true to the style .
**pours** **nearly** **black** **,** **yeilding** **a** **murky** **brown** to the light , **with** **a** **very** **nice** **dull** **tan** **head** **.** the smell is sour and earthy . the taste is hard to pinpoint , as it is complex , but it is not very bold . malts and clove with a tart aftertaste are present in nearly every sip , while anise , black and roasted malts , even lemon peel and black pepper take turns in the spotlight . the mouthfeel is very smooth , but at the same time slightly watery . drinkability is about medium , not at all effected by abv , but this beer is most certainly filling . overall , most certainly an enjoyable brew , but hard to pair with anything .
thanks to mday for opening this at a recent tasting . **a** **:** **pours** **near-black** **with** **a** **nice** **,** **thin** **tan** **head** **.** s : plenty of roasted malt characteristics alongside a nice blend of coffee and chocolate . t : coffee , chocolate , roasted malt , hints of toffee , and a small but existent hop presence m : smooth , medium-body with good carbonation . d : very nice . not normally one of my favorite styles , but i loved the smooth nature of this alongside the very nice balance of coffee and chocolate flavors .
**another** **interesting** **wild** **rose** **brew** . fresh at least . **pours** **a** **deep** **dark** **black** **,** **cloudy** **with** **good** **head** **and** **lacing** . smelled kind of metallic , vanilla and malt backbone . tastes like malted sour cherries and vanilla notes . pretty full beer , creamy with a tart sour cherry finish . nicely carbonated . thanks pootz .
**this** is a slightly **better** alternative to the **blue** **moons** out there trying **this** style . that is not to say this is at the bottom of the list of quality whitbeers . **poured** **nicely** **,** **with** **a** **cloudy/unfiltered** **body** **.** **white** **head** **lingered** long . smelled of bread and yeast , fruity ... **typical** **whit** smells the taste was good , not great . fruity and banana dominated the tastes , but like blue moon this felt slightly watered down and subdued . mouthfeel was crisp and smooth . overall an average beer . not horrible , i 'd drink it again if no better options are available ... but nothing to write home about . typical , if underachieving , whit beer .
12oz bottle **.** **pours** **cola-brown** **with** **a** whisp on the surface and a **few** **dots** **of** **lacing** aromatics lead off with roasted malts with hints of chocolate , vanilla and nougat . pretty mild and meak . medium bodied and the mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side for a porter . mildly spritzy . mild roasted malts , dark caramel , and a hint of vanilla start the palate . traces of burnt sugar and char follow through . finishes with light traces of vanilla and roast pretty unimpressive . not offensive but certainly nowhere near as robust or vanilla-like as i would have enjoyed . reminds me of vanilla coke .
**poured** **a** **surprisingly** **large** **,** **4-finger** **head** **.** **deep** **,** **amber** **color** **was** **impressive** ( insert sound of screeching tires ... ) smell was typical grolsch euro trash - sour , without anything balancing . please do n't smell this beer if you have one . taste had some light caramel , little bitterness and pine-nuttiness . i 'm rating slightly below avg for this style mouthfeel was ok , relatively smooth , and good carbonation throughout actually drinkable , if you plug your nose and do n't expect anything spectacular . one of the 'better ' offerings from gross , um , i mean grolsch .
poured from bomber into a pint glass as part of a side-by-side tasting with duck-rabbit baltic porter . **a** **:** **brown-black** **with** **a** **thin** **head** . s : not much of a nose from this bottle . coffee and caramel or toffee . t/mf : great taste : silky smooth in the mouth . malty with a toffee finish . crisper finish than expected . d : very drinkable example of the style , good flavor combined with lighter mf makes for great experience .
**spanking** new at beer bistro on-tap . medium **mouthfeel** **,** **neutral** **yellow-gold** **.** **not** **much** **head** **,** **creamy** . malty more than bitter . sweetish aftertaste . like other durhams , light and fresh , this one very fresh , but also with edges rounded out for acceptability . good transition ale .
**hazy** **bright** **orange** **in** **color** **with** **a** **fluffy** **white** **head** **that** **quickly** **dissapates** **,** **leaving** **delicate** **lace** . way too **orange** looking . aroma is very mild wheat and subtle spice completely dominated by artificial orange . smells like tang . flavor ditto . tastes like an artificially flavored witte . there 's no way the orange flavor is authentic . mouthfeel is actually nice and creamy with that good wheaty quality . too bad it tastes like an orange soda .
thanks to murph for the sample ... . **poured** **a** **bright** **,** **clear** **copper** **color** **,** **with** **a** **thin** **,** **tight** **head** **,** and just a **hint** **of** **lacing** in the glass . nose was subdued , malty , with some peaty notes . good mouthfeel for the bruce . taste exhibited some malt , but too weak . some smoky/peaty action in there , as well as a touch of hops at the end lending some bitterness . i was looking for more malt and sweetness ... .not to be found here . overall : 3.55 appearance : 3.5 | smell : 3.5 | taste : 3.5 | mouthfeel : 4 | drinkability : 3.5
**poured** **out** **dark** **,** **cloudy** **and** **brown** **with** **a** **creamy** **off-white** **head** . the nose is sugar , molasses , bread , and a bit of alcohol . the taste is similar to the smell but with a slightly smokey aspect . this aspect is a bit much , but the molasses and alcohol and a big bite that balances . the mouthfeel is creamy with a bit of carbonated bite . the finish is ever so slightly on the huge side .
**uber** **rarity** **,** **unfortunately** the bottle i received was corked . from notes . appearance : **pour** **is** **a** **red-orange** **amber** **,** **small** **white** **head** . smell : off musty / rotten flavors that you expect from corked wine ; i have sampled in the neighborhood of 30-50 bottles of cantillon in my life and this is the first one that has been 'bad ' , i knew almost instantly that something was amiss taste : the must / rotten flavors dominate on the first sip . very much a tca issue , there was no way to finish it or enjoy the bottle . this is not 'good ' funk , as i typically enjoy those sorts of flavors , from cantillon in particular . sourness was still there . it is one of those things some people do n't pick up on , but once you know the taint you will always detect it . mouthfeel : dry , thin , medium carbonation . drinkability : as described above , this bottle clearly had some issues . i doubt i get to try it again and do not know where those issues came from , but as-is it was undrinkable . i noticed some people may have picked up on this from reading other reviews , to a lesser extent , while some may not have had an issue at all .
**a** **:** **pours** **a** **burnt** **orangish** **red** **color** **.** not quite copper , but close **.** **a** **decent** **foam** **head** **that** **eventually** **disappears** **.** **blotchy** **lacing** that lasts the whole drink . s : lots of hops and barley . lots of citrus with just a small sprinkling of malt . t : lots of citrus hop flavoring , with some caramel , toffee and bread . the hop flavoring definitely is the more predominant . m : a slick oily mouthfeel . d : a good ale with a high abv . not a good session beer . would be worth cellaring .
picked up at gordon 's in watertown bottle 051/502781 bottled 1/20/10 poured in to my portsmouth tulip a : **this** **beer** **pours** **a** **cloudy** **,** **ruddy** **,** **dark** **brown** **with** **some** **reddish** **highlights** to it **.** **a** **huge** **finger** **of** **creamy** **khaki** **color** **head** **caps** **this** **beer** **off** **.** **head** **recedes** **at** **a** **moderate** **pace** **leaving** **chunks** **of** **sticky** **lacing** on the glass s : nose is rather musty and musky , some yeast and wheats filter in , a sweet character comes through and a bit of earthiness . t : taste is yeast , wheat , massive funk that basically fills out the middle . so musty and musky , but mingled with a crazy almost caramel malt sweetness . hints of ... a earthy , hay like quality in the finish . m : medium to full body , moderate carbonation , light yet creamy body . d : goes down alright , milder kick than the abv would indicate , a decent beer but i would go with others of the style .
**a** **:** **the** **pour** **is** **an** **amber** **sort** **of** **color** **with** **a** **nice** **finger** **'s** **worth** **of** **off-white** **head** **.** s : a very pleasant citrus hop aroma of grapefruits and oranges along with a very nice pine note . a bit of sweet caramel malt underneath . t : there is a bit more malt sweetness than i generally prefer for an ipa , but the piney hops provide a really excellent bitterness to the beer . the citrus notes are more subtle , but quite pleasant . m : medium both in terms of body and carbonation with a nice bitter finish . d : this was really nice and i always enjoy trying a beer from a ( new to me ) brewery . i would definitely give this one another go .
**12** **oz** **a-** **orange** **tinged** **light** **amber** **,** **a** **nice** **head** that does n't quite **fully** **dissipate** **,** **and** **leaves** **beautiful** **lacing** down my mug . s-piney/grapefruit hops . that 's about it , the low spot of the beer . t- love the flavor complexity of racer five . initial pine/grapefruit hops , much like the nose , but then it smooths out to a biscuit malt flavor with that wonderful apricot sweetness . ends with a bitterness/dryness that 's just enough to make you want the next sip m- feels thicker than it looks with just enough carbonation . almost creamy initially in the mouth . d- really , really nice change up from most ipa 's . highly drinkable . i really enjoy this as a change up to the normal dogfish head 60 min , smuttynose , and victory hop devil that are readily available in my area .
served **in** **a** **hoegaarden** glass at just over fridge **temperature** **appearance-** **pours** **a** **cloudy** **pale** **gold** **,** **the** **head** **cresting** at about two **fingers** and **settling** to a **fine** **mat** **.** **looks** **like** a good witbier , solid in appearance . smell- bold , no-holds-barred display of coriander spice and orange peel ... fresh and spritzy , allagash does n't disappoint here . really nice . taste- solid wheat notes , maybe more textural but definitely there ... backed by the smooth coriander and beautifully floral hop character . the beer has terrific balance and runs its course so eloquently for this style . mouthfeel/drinkability- light and prickly in the beginning , it swells in such a smooth , easy way ... emphasizing the spices and wheat character . light but very distinctive and totally appropriate . what a great witbier , the best u.s . take on the style .
**pours** **a** **deep** **brown** **color** . it 's got the characteristic brown ale flavor with some caramel and a big dry hop punch . i like brown ales , and i like hops , but the flavors seemed unintegrated to me . i would have preferred they blend more . not my **favorite** **dogfish** head brew , though it was refreshing served cold on a hot day .
**a** **cloudy** **amber** **mahogany** **beer** **with** **a** **light** **khaki** **head** **.** **some** **fantastic** **retention** **but** **no** **real** **lacing** . smell has some floral fruitiness and a light pine scent but not super hoppy . its more of a malt sweetness with some nice carmel toasted toffee scents . there is a grainy solvent like smell that tips you off to the higher abv . a medium body with a sweet malty flavor . fine smooth ( champagne like ) carbonation that is n't over the top but a nice compliment to the tastes . there is a slight bitterness and a warm toasted toffee flavor that is n't too intense . a smooth and creamy feel in the mouth with a fine dry aftertaste . makes me want to drink some more . very pleasing and easy to drink . the bottle has a best by date of 09/08/2010 . impressive how the brewery knows the exact date their beverage expires . very worth a try .
**dark** **,** **deep** **,** **cloudy** **brown** **with** **a** **tan** **head** . sweet yeast , apples , grapes , fruit , honey . malty , honey , caramel , citrus , fruit , spice , with a bit of alcohol . delicious and complex . nice , long finish . medium to full body with perfect carbonation . goes down easy . i drank a whole 750ml by myself .
**clear** **medium** **copper/amber** **with** **a** **substantial** **tan** **head** **that** **retains** fairly well but does **n't** **manage** **much** **lacing** the aroma is toasted grain , a hint of caramel and just a faint trace of grass and citrus the taste also starts off with a toasted malt note but is followed quickly by a kick of very grassy hops , which intensifies toward the finish with a burst of citrus peel ( grapefruit ? ) and a carbonic aftertaste light bodied , highly carbonated but easy enough to drink . the best i 've had yet from weston , but still needs a bit of work .
**exceptionally** **good** . bought at the library in manhattan , kansas , but enjoyed back home in oklahoma . incredible maple/malt aroma . flavor is exactly as described . a full and complex scotch ale with lots of caramel and toasted malt . the maple works well with it , just an added extra bit of goodness . mouthfeel is nice and velvety . nice alcoholic warmth , but not overpowering . i like this one a lot . i should have bought more than one bottle .
on tap at **the** beer company **.** **a** **:** **yellow** **gold** **with** **a** **large** **white** **head** **,** **decent** **retention** **,** **and** **no** **lacing** . s : redolent of pear , apple , and banana . wheat and grain provide the malt foundation , and there 's a light phenolic note that reminds me of clove . sweetness is at an upper light level . t : apple and wheat with banana and light clove . the beer has a lower moderate sweetness with a lot of yeast-driven fruit notes . the finish is dry , smooth , and lightly spicy with no evident alcohol . m : lower medium body with moderate carbonation . the mouthfeel is smooth and sticky . overall : a solid belgian pale ale .
**poured** **a** **cloudy** **red-orange** **color** **with** **a** **quickly** **dissipating** **head** **leaving** **little** **lacing** . aroma was a little bread like with a different mix of hops that i did n't care for , just did n't seem right . same with the taste , tasted a bit like old grass . medium bodied with a little above average carbonation , seemed alright in this aspect . i just did n't really care for this , i did n't even finish the entire 12oz bottle , so i ca n't give it a high number on drinkability . i was hoping to like this more , i enjoyed their oatmeal stout , but i will pass on this one .
22oz bomber - thanks to jfam for **this** **appearance** **-** **slightly** **hazy** **dark** **amber/copper** **colour** **with** **a** **small** **size** **fizzy** **white** **coloured** **head** **.** there is a low amount of carbonation showing and there is **some** **faint** **lacing** **.** **the** **head** lasted for only a minute minutes . smell - malts , caramel , hops , grapefruit taste & mouth - there is a low amount of carbonation and i can taste malts , caramel and some hops . there is also a bit of tangerine and grapefruit . it ends with a malty sweet aftertaste with a medium amount of lingering hop bitterness . overall - there has to be something wrong with my bottle.. it 's almost like it 's from a cask . there was **no** head , and the beer is basically flat . i can tell that the beer has some promise , but this is not what i was expecting . i see no code/date on the bottle . oh well , i 'll try to re-review , but i 'll probably just end up buying sculpin instead .
poured into pint glass from 22oz bottle **a** **--** **dark** **copper/amber** **color** **with** **a** **nice** **1** **finger** **head** s -- caramel and toffee roasted malts t -- sweetness follows the nose and leaves a nice wash on the palette nicely balanced flavors m -- nice medium body and finish is clean d -- light carbonation and sweetness is nice this is a well done scotch ale i was looking forward to this one at the vbf and incredibly disappointed when not available thanks to village vineyards in plymouth who was well stocked
**a** **one-finger** **frothy** on top of a **see-thru** **brown** body . subdued roasted malt smell mixed with some toasted and sweet malt smells as well . nice smoothness with a subdued dry backbite . has caramel sweetness and maybe some sugar cane with a little tartness from the hops . a low-key quality brown .
**amber** **head** **dossent** **last** to long s : it smells so good and fruity i think it going to be sweet it smeels like cherys and other fruits t : you can taste the fruit at first then the hoppyness hits you o : agian i love this company i guess my expectations are so high because the story of this company . i would definatly not pass this beer up must try
**short** **tan** **head** **with** **poor** **retention** smell is similar to darkness with the sweeter fruit aromas coming through . there is a lot more roast which is a nice change of pace . there is also a bit of smokiness that comes from british roasted malts . more bitterness as a result of the roasted malts , again a very slightly smoked flavor comes through which adds a nice layer to the taste . medium bodied beer with perfect carbonation overall , i went in to this one expecting not to like it but it ended up being one of my favorites . much dryer than most of the highly rated imperial stouts on this site , which i like , and that added smoke really brings this to another level .
**pours** **a** **very** **hazy** **yellow** **with** a hint of orange . smells very citrusy/hoppy and scared me originally when i sniffed it . had all the makings of a pale ale nightmare . how happily wrong i was . has a **very** **active** **bubbly** **white** **head** **that** **just** **looks** **great** **receding** down the tulip glass . damn **good** looking beer . the taste is interesting . syrupy sweet with a hint of malt and a lot of lemon/grass/pepper up front . quite a good sized body for a mild beer . finishes sweet as it began with some nice carbonation tingling on the tounge . another gem from ommegang .
**this** **beer** **pours** **a** **full** **bodied** **dull** **golden** **in** **color** **with** **a** **two** **finger** **bright** **white** **head** . this has got to be the thickest wheat beer i 've ever seen . imagine a gold imperial stout in appearance . the aromas are earthy , grassy , lemon , and feature a tart yeasty aspect which is quite interesting . the flavors took me by surprise . it 's moderately tart and you can pick up the different yeasts . it 's very grassy and again features a lemon like tartness . it drinks kind of dry and is full in body . the viscosity makes this wheat a little harder to get through than most . drinking a glass makes you feel like you just consumed a loaf of bread . it 's definitely an interesting beer and i 'm glad it had so much complexity for the style . i 'd recommend trying this one , but probably sharing it with a friend .
**this** **is** the **common** **generally** **available** 'bitter ' beer on hand pull in many pubs in my home town area in uk . **unfortunately** since **coors** took over the bass brewery some years ago **,** **the** beer has changed its character somewhat to how it tasted 10 years ago . it can also be very variable in quality , and i am not sure if this is due to the way it is kept by the pub staff , or the fault of the brewery . when in good condition ( and the best way to have it is straight from the barrel by gravity **feed** **and** **no** **head** , though thats rare to see ! ) it is a medium **dark** colour ( for a 'pale ' ale ) rich and inviting , with a more maltly aroma , but also a bit sulphury from the 'burton water ' that characterises this style and origin of the beer . the taste is smooth and malty , the hoppy bitterness well in the background , also hints of spicyness . over the last few years it seems to be less flavourful , the general malty smooth taste can remain , but less depth of flavour and character , and sometimes a bit sour and appears to be 'off ' in recent tastings of the beer , on more than one occasion we have had to take the beer back because it was obviously going off . this is a great shame , as it was a great traditional british beer with lots of character and easy to drink . i have rated it disregarding the 'off ' samples had recently b'ham uk
poured into my oversized **wine** **glass** **with** **a** **strong** **bubbly** **head** **and** **a** **nice** **brown/copper** body . a cherry cough drop aroma to it , some malts and grains there too , not bad . flavor : first a sourness like lime , a berry note thoughout , theres grains and a slite bite in the end . carbonation is apparent . it 's very well drinkable .
**this** **winter** **ale** **has** **a** **dark** **brown** **appearance** **and** **foamy** **head** . the aroma is a pleseant toasted nut . the taste has a big nut flavor upfront that becomes slightly hoppy . the flavor moves into a spice on the back end . the body is medium for a winter brew . the thirst for another is not too great . overall i like to have one of these every season for a nice switch .
poured from a 750ml bottle into three snifters . thanks to pops and heatherann for the assist a : **pours** **a** **pure** **,** **evil** **black** **.** **dark** **mocha/rust** **colored** **foam** **.** **loads** of **suspended** **sediment** . s : big aromas of bitter dark chocolate , fudge brownies , and dark fruit drizzled with chocolate . t : see above with flourless chocolate cake , campfire ashes , burnt espresso , and chocolate covered cherries . m : creamy/pillowy foam with a dry and ashy body . huge notes of spicy hop bitterness . sweet middle with a silky smooth finish that leads into some minor solvent alcohol astringency . o : made me want to kiss the goat
**a** **nicer** **color** **than** a lot of light **lagers** i 've seen . a bit darker than normal perhaps **.** **no** head to speak of . no scent to speak of . very little taste to speak of . slightly malty , but in general fairly bland . considering the name they gave this one , i expecting a beer with a bit more power . i guess the hops give it a tiny bit of spice , but it 's not so much a lightning bolt as licking a 9-volt battery . this one just fails to impress all around . order one of hops ' darker brews .
had this on tap at the first street **draught** house in town . i 've had this in bottle form , but this is a first on tap . came **out** **a** **dark** **brown** **with** **ruby** **edges** **and** **a** **good** **1-inch** **tan** **head** **on** **top** **.** **retention** was fair , but there was **tons** **of** **sticky** **lacing** on the glass edge . smells like molasses , brown sugar , toasted bread , and roasted nuts the mouth was creamy and smooth with a touch of carbonation on the tongue . the brown sugar that i found in the scent is also in the flavor . this is a pleasantly sweet , roasty brown ale . bitterness is low . plenty of malty goodness in this beer . i much preferred this beer on tap
**strong** **golden** **colour** **,** **with** **oranged** **reflexes** **,** a lot **of** **creamy** **and** **white** **foam** . the smell is very fresh , herbaceous and floreal ( roses ? ) , with cream , cereals ( oats ) . fizzy ( maybe a little too much ) , with a round taste , but 'simple ' , without the complexity of the smell . maybe lightly tannic-wood . the body is medium and round , with a good hop . we found a clear difference between two glasses , one with the bottom ( yeast ) of the bottle , and the other without it . in the first it was noticeable even some solvent ...
on tap at the trappist in oakland **,** **ca** **.** **nice** **dark** **amber** **appearance** **,** **great** **head** **retention** . cool sour wet horse blanket notes on the aroma that are mostly in aroma , not so much in the actual taste . pretty low carbonation for the style . much sweeter in the finish than you would expect from the aroma . nice complexity when you want a balance of sweet/sour . great complexity of flavors considering the alcohol content . very drinkable and enjoyable .

it 's **winter** **time** , my **favorite** time of year for seasonal **beers** , and this has caught my eye for a little while so i picked up a sixer . **pours** **nicely** **without** **much** **head** , but it 's **a** **nice** **dark** **copper** **color** **.** smell punches you in the face with nutmeg and cinnamon ; not quite what i 'm looking for , to be frank . the taste of nutmeg and cinnamon are way too up-front as far as i 'm concerned . totally overwhelms any depth that might be had with this beer in a totally superficial sort of way . i understand that it 's supposed to be a beer brewed with spices , but they really ought to be integrated with the beer , not the only thing it tastes like . it tastes a lot like pumpkinhead ale in this respect , actually , in that it 's way too overwhelming and poor . mouthfeel is average . easy to down , i guess , but the poor integration of the spices makes it difficult to stomach without holding your nose . find a better winter warmer . there are lots .
thanks to americanbrew for sharing this bottle **.** **the** **beer** **pours** **a** **yellow-amber** **color** **with** **a** **white** **head** **.** the aroma is alcohol , wheat , citrus and surprisingly , some darker fruit the flavor is grain , toffee and alcohol . after the aroma i was expecting a little more from the aroma , but it is still not bad medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation definitely better than the basic malt liquors that come in clear , 40 ounce bottles .
**i** had this on-tap at **eulogy** **.** **large** **,** **creamy** **head** . this beer has a nice , estery character , but it could be so much more . bottle-conditioned would be the preferred way to go with this one . very good on-tap . i would assume it would have much more complexity in the bottle . in my mind 's eye , i picture that tasting wonderfully . a lot of belgian beers are that way . remember , on-tap is not always better .
**pours** **a** **cloudy** **golden** **.** **thin** **white** **head** **,** **with** **some** **retention** **,** **and** **good** **lacing** . smell is of grassy hops , and fruit . body is thin , and carbonated . taste is mildly hopped , with a nice malt balance . more tart than bitter . some fruit tones throughout . had a bit of a bad after taste , othe than that , not bad .
**poured** **a** **deep** **brown** **color** **with** **little** **head** **that** **dissipated** **pretty** **quickly** . aroma is of sweet maltiness with chocolate and caramel notes . flavor is also of chocolate and caramel maltiness . mouthfeel is good a bit on the thick side . drinkability is ok . this is to be savored not sessioned .
**pours** **bright** **orange** **with** **small** **white** **foam** **that** **quickly** **disappears** . smells heavy of grapefruit and citrus , little maltiness . tastes as though grapefruit has been added . low carbonation . not getting much malt body through the bitterness of the hop . there is something in there though rounding off the corners . i was expecting a bold dipa/iipa but it seems this beer has taken a little different course than double-double . however , its mellowness is kind of appreciated . very nice , if muted , taste . the beer is lazy in the glass but does react on the tongue when sipping . mouthfeel is pretty good for a sipper of this type . drinkability is good assuming the known limit is 1-2 . is this the future of dipas ? i guess the oracle would know .
on tap at **the** **monks** **'** **kettle** **nice** **tight** **head** **that** **leaves** **heavy** **lacing** **.** **bright** **orange** **color** **,** **slightly** **cloudy** . a great complex aroma , with orange , bread , and piney hops . the taste combines a nicely balanced citrus fruitiness and bitterness with bready yeast flavors a juicy , dangerously drinkable and complex brew . well worth seeking out .
**clean** **,** **medium-copper** **body** **with** **light** **golden** **edges** **.** **small** **,** **filmy** **,** **off-white** **head** . nose is caramel cookie malts , cooked veggies , and spicy , if a bit mild , hops . toasted , slightly hoppy flavors up front . solid cookie dough malt follows . gets more vegetal , spicy , and caramelly . finish shows mild hop bitterness and lasting caramel cookie dough . not bad . moderate body with a slightly soapy feel . another decent cheap brew from tjs .
bottle into a standard **pint** **glass** **.** **dark** **amber** **to** **bronze** **pour** **,** **smallish** **off-white** **head** that moves to a **coating** **.** **lacing** is present **but** spotty . there is citrus , caramel , pine , and malt in the nose taste is citrus , floral , caramel , pine but a lot of caramel . this is mildly bitter in the finish . medium to heavier body with decent carbonation . decent ipa but heavy on the sweeter side ( not a plus for me ) and not much taste remains until the next sip . i would try this again but it is not on the top of my list .
**a** **-** **two** **fingers** **of** **sudsy** **white** **head** **,** the body **is** **hazy** **golden-brown** . s - strong fruity/ spicy aroma of plums , raisins , almonds , bananas , cloves , black pepper , anise , and a moderate level of wet , mossy , earthy funk . spectacularly complex aroma . t - bready banana flavor up front along with cloves , and nutmeg . some raisins and caramel appear in the middle and are replaced by molasses and chocolate in the finish along with a lingering tobacco note . m - medium-thick body , with very high carbonation , and a dry finish . d - wow , an amazingly complex beer . there is a bit of a disconnect between the dark flavors in this beer and its relatively light color . the carbonation borders on being a bit too high and the alcohol is kind of hot , but these minor flaws are overshadowed by the complexity , especially of the aroma . overall i am quite impressed with this beer and i ca n't wait to try some more of de dolle 's other offerings .
**pours** **a** **deep** **amber** **to** **black** **color** **with** **a** **light** **tan** **head** . in the aroma , coffee and chocolate that is quite pronounced . in the taste , coffee , dry chocolate and a hit of hoppy bitterness . a small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel , with a dry roasty coffee in the aftertaste . a nice coffee and chocolate taste , nice hop presence , really freakin ' good .
thanks to h1n1 for this one poured from 1l swing top bottle in to **duvel** **tulip** **glass** **a** **-** **dark** **amber** **colour** **with** **one** **finger** **of** **bubbly** **white** **head** **that** **quickly** **disappeared** s - pumpkin , cloves , cinnamon , nutmeg . standard nose for a pumpkin ale but not overly spiced , which many are . t - pumpkin , cloves & nutmeg are the predominant flavours . some cinnamon is here as well but not as pronounced as it is in many pumpkin ales . i do n't specifically taste the star anise but i am not sure i would know that taste if i found it anyway . a nice peppery taste is present in the finish m - medium body , nice chew , lightly carbonated d - nicely balanced pumpkin beer . not overly spiced like many pumpkin beers tend to be . this was was very well balanced ( pumpkin and spiced ) . one of the better pumpkin ales i have tried .
**a-pours** **a** **swarthy** **,** **reddish** **amber** **with** **a** **one-finger** **fluffy** **head** **of** **light-pinkish** **white.the** **head** **slowly** **recedes** **leaving** **thin** **strands** of lacing.mild to moderate carbonation is present . s-piny hops , gingerbread , mulling spice and toasty malt.this definitely smells like the holidays.not overdone on the spice though.hops are still a main player . t-dry spice , orange peel , clove and toffee/malt nuttiness.sweet citrus from the hops , deliberate spice and caramel . m-this beer is medium bodied with some active carbonation.it is relatively creamy with a dry finish and a lasting piny/spice aftertaste . d-i think if this beer is consumed when it is intended to be ( it is a winter warmer , correct it 's drinkability is pretty high .
*i am rating this for what it is ... a specialty **chocolate** **lager** ... i realize this may not be for everyone but for the style it **is** **quite** **nice..** **dark** **brown** **color** **...** **.creamy** **texture** in the mouth ... .medium bodied ... .huge sweet melted **milk** chocolate aroma ... .also some powdered hot cocoa mix.. taste is sweet and big on the milk chocolate ... .at first it seems almost a little too sweet but it finishes very clean ... drinks like a lager ... might be a bit much for some people but i think they did a nice job with this . i am amazed there is no 'real ' chocolate added . it tastes and smells like there is..also some wheat malt in this ... to me this is a souped up schwartzbeir on chocolate steroids ... i think this is a nice effort by miller and one that can serve as an after dinner beer for many ... even non-beer drinkers ...
**poured** from a 12 oz . brown bottle into a sam adams pint glass . **a** **:** **bright** **copper** **orange** **colored** **brew** **,** plenty of visible **carbonation** **.** **somewhat** **thick** **off-white** **head** that is **quite** **bubbly** **and** **recedes** **quickly** **to** **a** **quarter** **inch** **thick** **layer** **atop** **the** beer that slowly pops and bubbles over **.** **some** **tiny** **lacing** down the sides . s : warming hops fill the nose , mostly floral and a hint of citrus and maybe pine . a bit of sweet caramel malts , too . balanced but tiny . t : sweet malts and hops throughout . i 'm pleased with the balancing flavors of this beer . the good parts of a pale ale and a lager combined . m : the crispness of a lager and the tiny hop bite of a pale ale . pretty good . d : quite nice . i liked this one and could have more .
on tap **in** the maui brewing co tasting room in lahaina . **a** **:** **pale** **,** **golden** **in** **color** **.** **a** **decent** **head** with a fair **amount** **of** **bubbles** **and** **good** **lacing** . s : i pick up mostly banana bread and grapefruit , with a bit of hop aroma . t : malty , with some of the citrus noted in the aroma . pretty much what i was expecting given the style , though not overly exciting . m : refreshing and smooth with good carbonation . d : a refreshing brew for a hot day on maui . it would n't be my first choice , but a satisfying beer under the right circumstances .
**poured** from the bomber into two pint **glasses** **.** **deep** **amber** **color** **with** **very** **little** **head** **or** **lacing** . malty smell along with some basic spice notes . the malt is present in the tatse along with a pleasant light hops finish . this beer is very drinkable , not quite as earthy as i like my maibocks , but the drinkabilty is really good on this one , and i could go for another .
**appearance** **** **this** **was** **a** **glowing** **brown** **in** **color** **and** **very** **clear** **with** **a** **good** **,** **reputable** **head** . smell  the big , citrus hops did this bouquet proud . they did n't run away with the nose though , as this ale has a wonderful malty base and a good sense of alcohol . taste  the malts are huge at the taste , and the alcohol lightens up a bit making this a nicely balanced brew . the citrus hops are large and in charge . this is a flavor explosion . mouthfeel  this is a solid medium-bodied with a slick , almost greasy mouthfeel . it 's interesting , because the hops are huge but it 's not brutally bitter . drinkability  this is a good-drinking bigger beer that was the life of the party . comments  thanks to beerguy for donating this monster bomber to skyhand 's broken fridge party .
**this** **is** **mac** 's interpretation of an **india** **pale** **ale** . i 'm more inclined to call it a uniquely-hopped pale ale , rather than an ipa , but who am i to argue with the brewer . let me explain . this beer , according to mccashin 's , is a 'late hopped **pale** ale . ' in practical terms -- at least to my nose/tongue -- that results in a very raw hoppiness . they use a combination of five different hops -- all grown in nelson , nz -- and they 're not added until the end of the boil , which leaves a hoppy freshness right at the front of this beer . it 's almost as if the hops are not in this beer but on it . pours **a** **dark** **gold** **color** **with** **a** **slight** **amber** **hue** **.** **good** **,** **sticky** **head** **retention** . overall , this is a very unique brew . how unique ? consider this : in 4.5 months of traveling in europe ( including belgium & germany ) then new zealand , this is the only one i felt compelled to take notes on ! if you 're ever down new zealand , skip the lion red and export gold crap that floods the shelves and look for this beer . mac 's beers are made from 'all natural ingredients ' ( a phrase that actually has some meaning in new zealand ) .
**1** **year** **old** **bottle-** **dark** **chestnut** **with** **slight** **head** **but** **excellent** **retention** **.** **slight** **lacing** . the aroma has a bit of 'off ' scented hops . not bad , but not the a pleasant hop variety in terms of aroma . a lot of malt comes through but it 's well balanced . the taste actually reminds me a little of old ruffian . less aggresive on the hops though with a sweeter malt bill . there 's a bit of spiciness and a good dose of peat the body is medium full and medium heavy . carbonation is nice and light . the finish is dry and slightly sticky . overall , this was n't what i expected for a year old english style old ale but i was impressed nonetheless .
11.2oz bottle , sam **adams** glass , no freshness date **a** **shade** **darker** and deeper than a hearty **ipa** **,** **the** **head** is n't large but consistent . there was yeast in the bottle , as there should be , and i poured some but not all other than classic belgian yeast must , a nasally refreshing wintergreen lends almost physical coolness that can also be perceived as clean lemon . it could also even be clean pine , but not in a hoppy way lemon grass , ginger , smaller wintergreen . banana and clove via the yeast . this is a nice , complex , controlled beer of this style . moderate belgian biscuity malt , a little like its been sitting out in humidity . more cool lemon peel there is nothing special other than the flavors in the mouth and it 's thin i ca n't taste the alcohol , and because it adds nothing past intoxication potential i ca n't see why this beer needs to be 8.5 % abv .
i actually acquired this from another beer enthusiast of which whom i work with . he bought it from a grocery store that just opened up here in hampton roads and is known for their exotic foods at very low prices . i am known to drink a lot of wheat beers and he brought me a few to see what i thought . although it is a very light **wheat** beer , the flavor was spot-on for a hefeweizen . i was impressed with the aroma , and the affordability and taste made it a must have for my next dinner party .
**it** **'s** **an** **old** **classic** **in** **the** **'light** ' version . the **self-named** **champagne** **of** **beers** . now not so **premium** , but in the bottom of the cooler at albeit a bargain price . **mildly** **sweet** **corny** **smell** and a consistant lager taste . slight bitterness but consistent throughout from start to finish . good carbonation . not a unique beer for the demanding coniseur 's taste , but ice cold is a great way to refresh a hot summer day . brings back lots of memories of tall **blondes** . a summer sessioner without a doubt . i can drink this all day or all night long ( or both ) . i see they 've even bumped up the ac a tad .
the bottle i have is called paradox longrow , and has **japanese** writing **on** **half** **the** label . since the springbank distillery produces the longrow expressions , this may be the same thing as the paradox springbank batch 17 , but in the interest of simplifying things , let 's make a longrow entry , since springbank does make other whiskys . this **beer** **pours** **an** **opaque** **black** **,** **with** **reddish-copper** **edges** **,** **and** **two** **fingers** **of** **soapy** **beige** **head** **,** **that** **leaves** **consistent** **webbed** **lacing** as **it** **recedes** . it smells of bitter roasted coffee , and a little salty , peaty seaside essence . the taste is mildly bitter coffee , chocolate , butterscotch , vanilla , and a slight resinous herbal character . the alcohol is very well integrated , appearing only as a slight overall warming . the carbonation is quite low , the body fairly full , creamy , and a bit slick , and it finishes with a little more of those understated island seaside whiskey notes - salt , iodine , peat . this is more tame , yet also more balanced , than the previous whiskey barrel riss that i 've had from brewdog . it 's quite enjoyable , a lovely sipper .
**pours** **a** **dark** **brown** **that** **shows** **ruby** **highlights** **when** held into **the** **light** **.** **thin** **off-white** **head** **that** **has** **decent** **retention** **and** **shows** **minimal** **lacing** . extremely **clear** . the nose is very sweet and very malty . roasted malts take over the nose at first , but chocolate and coffee notes battle it out . not overly complex nose , but a solid one nonetheless . taste is exactly what you would expect from the nose , no surprises here . roasted malts dominate , coffee and chocolate come into play , but do n't compete with the roasted malts dominance . there is a slight spicey character that was not noticed in the nose , but now that i taste it i can definitely see it being in the nose as well . 7.3 % abv is nowhere to be found . medium body , very smooth and rich . light carbonation . i find this very drinkable , and the 7.3 % abv is not noticeable at all . if this were available in my area , i would be getting this all the time .
**pours** **a** **clear** **golden/yellow** **with** **a** **medium** **head** **that** **leaves** **decent** **lacing** . this really looks like any other large **macro** beer . the smell is sweet malt , floral , and 'bisquity ' . the taste is crisp with a lemon flavor along with sweet malt , floral , bread yeast , and honey . the m/f is light with flavors mixing well . not a bad beer , but it 's really not that great .
**appearance** **:** **appropriately** **orange** **with** **a** **full** **creamy** **head** **and** **lacing** . smell : more subdued than dfh punkin or weyerbacher imperial in the nutmeg , cardamom space . a distinctive toffee in the nose . taste : this one comes together well . lighter than the aforementioned and more 'sessionable ' . more like pumpkin pie . drinkability : had this at a local restaurant where i usually switch up , but stayed with this
**pours** **a** **clear** **reddish** **amber** **with** **a** **couple** **scant** **bubbles** rising **hither** and yon **topped** **off** **with** **a** **thin** **khaki** **collar** **bright** **citrus** orange and tangerine hops with a good balance of malts and the hops first swigs : well balanced easy smooth hops and malt . a solid mix that says am ipa all the way . some smooth orange citus and almost rye malt . fast fasing finish . a touch of peach too . some tackiness . medium bodied feel with a soft carbonation . since there a million beers out there just like this , it 's hard to go ga-ga on drinkability . last swigs : orange lolipop ! thanks to aksmoked porter for the bottle .
**appearance** **-** **cloudy** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **little** **amount** **of** **head** **atop** . smell - light wheaty and orange/citrusy smell to it . taste - very smooth and sweet . calming enough to have a few more . mouthfeel - little carbonation and smooth . drinkability - decent try at a wheat .
**medium** **gold** **color** **with** **a** **big** **fluffy** **head** **,** **fades** quckely light hoppes and a sour skunky flavor extremely one dimensional light malts slightly bitter hop finish light and carbonated goes down easy i 'd say this beer is a few rungs above budweiser about the same level as heineken i would never buy this beer again unless i was at some sort of bar that only sold macros i 'd rather save the money and buy an 18 of high life or buy an actual half way decent beer
**poured** into a mother earth tulip . a - **slightly** **less** **than** **a** **one-finger** **,** **tan** **head** **that** **faded** **to** **a** **patchy** **cap** **;** **a** **bit** **of** **spotty** **lacing** **;** **dark** **brown** **color** with **quite** **a** **bit** **of** **ruby-orange** **highlights** s - rye , molasses t - very similar to aroma ; sweet throughout with a pronounced malt bill that tastes similar to rye to me ; some maple and hazelnut ; does not dry out much at end m - light-med fine prickly carbonation that provides a bit of crispness to the otherwise sweet and somewhat heavy body d - i am not an expert on the style by any means but it seems like a cross between an american brown and an amber ; still enjoyable none the less ; just a bit too sweet and heavy to be extremely drinkable for me
**poured** from a 12oz bottle into a snifter : **appearance** **and** smell : poured **a** **very** **dark** **brown** , just about black and did n't allow much light through . had **a** **very** **minimal** **cream** **colored** **head** **which** **dissipated** **quickly** and just sat at the edge of the glass . smelled of roasty almost burned coffee , along with some sweet mocha chocolate notes . nice strong smelling brew . taste and mouthfeel : tasted of coffee , burned sugar and a hint of bitter sweet chocolate which resides with the sweet caramel malt presence . was pretty light to medium bodied with a noticeable carbonation presence . left a dry , earthy hop bitterness in the finish . drinkability : very drinkable , pretty light feel overall . finished with a bit more bitterness than expected . i 'd definitely drink more of this for sure , just probably would n't seek it out .
**a** **-** **light** **golden** **straw** **with** **little** **to** **no** head , even when intentionally poured with no **decanting** **.** **small** **lacing** . s - smells like a macrolager with an almost metallic tang t - decently bitter lager , no more no less . m - light , watery body with a carbonated finish d - i 'm not sure what the big deal is about beck 's , it reminds me of a more bitter heineken , which i suppose excites some palates , but not particulary mine .
**a** **bright** **,** **golden** **filtrated** **beer** **with** **a** **thick** **head** **.** smell is like a tripel , with solvent and fruity smells , but it also has a distinct dirty socks smell that is very disturbing . taste is light malty with a nice yeast profile of exotic fruits and a little solvent and higher alohols . again this strange taste comes up and develops from dirty socks into overcooked vegetables . especially when swallowed this taste is at the end of my tongue . one of the few drained beers i had .
22oz bottle acquired via trade with hopderek aroma : strong hop aroma coming out of the pour , citrus hops as is typical among american **ipas** . **a** nice smelling ipa , it previews what its going to bring **appearance** **:** **beautiful** **amber** **color** **with** **an** **inch** **or** **so** **of** **moderately** **fluffy** **white** **head** **,** **which** **produces** **fine** **lacing** . a standard look for the style . taste : slick malt taste is the main component , but the hops still bite -- bitter hops are there to keep the taste in check , and to leave you wanting more feel : this one was super balanced , as the malt really made this one smooth on the tongue . a nice medium body on the beer with a nice dose of carbonation too . drinkability : i had to look up the abv , as the alcohol did not come out very strong . 8.4 % is hidden quite well , and without the harsh , mouthful of hops taste that other ipas have , this one is quite pleasant to drink all told , odyssey is a pretty good double ipa , pretty easy to drink too , but there are still several others i would rather have . definitely worth a try though
served from bottle into a stone nonic . **poured** **a** **deep** **dark** **brown** **with** **a** **half** **finger** **light** **tan** **head** **that** **subsided** to a **minimal** **amount** **quickly** **.** **maintained** **decent** **lacing** throughout the glass . the aroma was comprised of sweet malt , maple syrup , and caramel . the flavor was of sweet malt , maple syrup , caramel , wood , and subtle tart . it had a medium feel with medium-high carbonation . overall this was a decent brew . i really was n't that impressed with this one if i am honest . glad that the alcohol presence was n't here though as it would have made it unbearable for me with these flavors . nothing too memorable here at all . worth trying if you get the chance but that is about it .
**aromas** of lightly roasted malts , some lighter toffee and a light earthy hoppiness the taste begins with a lot of the same ; toasted and bready malty grains , caramels , toffee sweetness . as it warms there is some light earthy , almost metallic bitterness , which is rather unpleasant to be honest . the finish is pleasantly dry with some detection of mineral water flavors which adds a nice dryness . overall this is nothing to write home about or seek out because of the generic flavors , especially because of the unnecessarily high abv which inhibits further consumption . if i 'm consuming something over 6 abv it needs flavor , which this is lacking .
on tap at **pope** **in** **philly** **pours** **a** **completely** **clouded** **golden** **color** **with** **some** **yellow** **hues** **.** **thick** **,** **frothy** **white** **head** **retains** **well** on top , fading into some layers of film **with** **some** **rings** **of** **lacing** on the glass spicy and citrusy on the nose . some lemon peel and cracked pepper with a hint of orange sweetness . barely any alcohol with some soft brett funk and yeast splash of floral hops up front with peppery spice . some herbal notes followed by citrus juiciness and lemon peel . a little sweet in the middle from the fruit . hints of bretty funk and belgian yeast , but not quite tart . finishes a little spicy medium body , higher carbonation , refreshing and tingly on the palate . a solid saison , although i was hoping for more brett presence .
got a small bottle for $ 7 at tap and table in emmaus , pa . poured into a large snifter , the beer is a bit of a foamer and really needs to warm up before it comes to life . even then the hops are n't that big , though flowery hops dominate the taste . there 's a light bready flavor in the background and behind the more citrusy hops in the aroma . of course , as a good belgian , the boy is drinkable , relatively light for its strength , and complimented by typical , sweet belgian spice .
bottle poured into a recently purchased **duvel** glass . the appearance **is** **a** **dull** **golden** with a **never-ending** **cascade** **of** **tiny** **bubbles** **heading** **towards** **a** **gigantic** **white** **frothy** **head** **.** **the** head will lessen **but** **stick** around **and** **lace** the glass **with** **white** **frothy** **bubbles** . the smell is light and spicy with a hint of alcohol . the taste is nice smooth , crisp and carbonated . you hardly notice the alcohol , but it warms the body . head still existent throughout . a drinkable beer indeed .
**i** **drank** **this** beer fresh , i will buy one to age and compare **results** **.** **appearance** **:** **poured** **a** **hazy** **,** **yellow** **,** **peachy** **color** **with** **a** **huge** **fluffy** **white** **head** . smell : i picked up a lot of smells , but mostly a peach/apricot smell taste : nice balanced taste little warming in the head , some nice peach/apricot type flavor even a little bubblegum flavor . a creamy , carbonated mouthfeel with a alcohol warming in the end drinkability : very nice and interesting beer . nice beer to enjoy with others
**poured** from a 22oz into a rogue pint glass this beer is made with harrington , klages , **cascades** and crystal hops . imported chocolate and rolled oats creates a beyond wonderful **flavor** **.** **ebony** **on** **color** **with** **a** **rich** **creamy** **head** . an earthy flavor of oats and hops that gives way to a rich chocolate truffle-ish finish . the flavor changes with the temperature to develop from more chocolate to more malts . this is a go-to beer .
**i** **like** **this** . **a** good history to it **,** **and** **a** **nice** **beer** **.** **dark** **,** **ruby** **brown** **with** **a** **thin** **head** **the** **clings** to the glass like crazy . light chocolate and caramel . big roasted malts , light fruity hops . faint vinous notes . lightly bitter caramel and roasted malt taste . chocolate , cherries and wine lurk in the background . light floral taste on the back of the tongue . very smooth , lightly oil body . mild carbonation hint . a nice strong ale , and almost sessionable .
**pours** **a** **nice** **light** **mahogany** **with** **a** **wispy** **beige** **head** **,** and is , for all purposes , a nice looking barleywine . rich brown sugar on the nose , underpinned by earthiness and a c-hop backing . a touch of alcohol too , but that 's to be expected . good hoppy flavour , with a delightful splash of citrus and pine , and a lasting bitterness . this is balanced quite well by a brown sugar sweetness and a touch of sherry . full-bodied , medium carbonation and warming . lagunitas know how to use their hops to good effect
**a** **-** **cloudy** **brownish** **red** **with** **a** **khaki** **colored** **head** **.** **slight** **film** **of** **head** left on **top** **.** **great** **lacing** s - smoky spicy and slightly alcoholic . caramel malts with a little sweet fruitiness t - sweet ripe fruits , caramel malts , sweet alcohol bite , seems very delicate yet full of flavor . slight bitterness that dissipates into a clean yet mildly dry finish m - full bodied without much carbonation for a smooth mouthfeel d - this is an outstanding ale . i could n't really find a scotch ale i liked , until now . the only problem is that it costs about $ 6 a bottle around here . wo n't be having this one too often because of the price , but it will be a real treat every time i do .
**a** **:** **pours** **a** **light** **brown/orange** **with** **very** **little** **head** s : had a nice citrus smell with a ton of booze , and i mean a ton ... t : the alcohol really overpowered the beer , specifically the after taste ; had a good taste for a barley wine , but not as smooth as others m : went down smooth , more like an after dinner drink than a barley wine in my opinion d : while overall i thought it was a good barley wine , the alcohol content was a little much . i would recommend having two a the most in one sitting , unless you are looking to get lit up big time .
served **in** a snifter at **the** brewpub . had to dance with the cask brew during our three floyds brewpub experience today . **it** **pours** **a** **hazed** **sunrise** **russet-amber** **topped** **by** **a** **finger** **of** **ecru** **micro-foam** . the nose comprises orange zest , toffee , caramel , flowers , and light bright greens ( you know , the part of the **lettuce** head that has the least amount of vitamins and whatnot ) . the taste brings in more of the same , along with some extra caramel and toffee , some red grapes , and a subtle leek character lurking devilishly in the background . the body is a strong medium , with a mild carbonation and a rather smooth feel . overall , a very nice b-wine , the standout of the experience .
**a** **-** **very** **deep** **red** **body** ( **black** if not held near light ) with **a** **small** **pale** **head** . s - smokey with notes of caramel t - toasted barley taste with smooth transition to light hop finish m - nicely carbonated with exceptionally smooth finish d - a true porter , very drinkable overall - another great beer from anchor brewing .
**bison** **organic** **ipa** **the** **appearance** **of** **this** **beer** **is** **a** **cloudy** **amber** **hue** . an unfiltered orgainic beer is sort of 'tree-hugger ' sounding . i 've had one organic ipa beer before and it totally ruined my view of the word 'organic ' when refering to beer . the nose on this beer is very nice . fresh hops and a slight malt sweetness . at first taste , i really like the beer . it has a bread-like flavor to it but still stays hoppy . the mouthfeel of the beer is crisp and direct . it definitely registers as a west coast ipa . i 'm not sure what type of hops are used but its not the typical cascade , simcoe , centennial combo . maybe its the 'organic ' hops ? as for drinkability , i could handle a couple of these but use it more as a stepping stone to a higher hopped ipa during a session . nice solid ipa ; changed my view of 'organic '
**the** **brew** **pours** **a** **dark** **brown/black** **colour** **.** **the** head is tall and brown . the nose almost reminds me of long trail 's porter ( brewery only ) in that the hops dominate the malts outright . when drinking though the hops and the malts harmonize and balance each other nicely , well done ( original date of review- 2/11/08 )
**pours** **black** **with** **ruby** **highlights** **and** **an** **off-white** **head** . nose shows bold milk chocolate by the truckload along with cocoa and some soft roasted malt . some spicy hops are evident in the background - just . that chocolate is awesome flavours include more of a roasty character but still show a lot of dark chocolate . these two flavours linger on well past the soft bitterness . carbonation is the main flaw , it 's too high to accompany these rich flavours . otherwise very impressive .
**a-** **pours** **a** **nice** **deep** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **thin** **white** **head** **that** **retains** a little less well than was expected **but** **did** **lace** **ok** . s- somewhat light , a sweet toasty malty smell with a very light hop aroma t- nice clean malty sweetness at first then a nice citrusy hoppy bitterness that was mch more pronounced in taste as opposed to the smell m- clean , crisp , nice carboantion , medium/light body d- a nice and drinkable brew , goes down esily , low abv , smooth body , not too highly priced either as i recall , pretty good beer
thanks ratman for giving me a bottle of this one the other day . good **refreshment** for late afternoon . **poured** **a** **nice** **dark** **golden** **color** **with** **a** **good** **sized** **white** **head** **.** aromas of bread , cereal and light hops . on the palate , light bodied , with cereal , corn and bread .
**a** **:** **poured** **a** **dark** **golden** **amber/orange** **with** **a** **thin** **head** s : very strong apricot and citrus aroma , gave way to a rather strong alcohol waft when swirled in the glass . t : very smooth and full flavored , very sweet with a warming alcohol finish . the first dinks were fruity with hints of honey , after i had a chance to warm a bit ; it gave way to a sweeter honey flavor m : very thin mouthfeel due to the high alcohol content and low carbonation . a small sip went a long way to coat all of your taste buds .
**an** **expansive** **gloomy** **head** **with** **great** **retention** over an **ebony** **vacuum** . the scent is of tantalizing dutch dark chocolate and roasted malts . the taste is absolutely unbelievable . rich chocolate cake with a warm swirl of alcohol , topped with a taste of cascade hops to add to the bittersweet cocoa finish . medium to heavy , very balanced mouthfeel . one bomber was not enough to satisfy . need more . many more . the bar has been raised . hats way off to this one .
**i** had this on tap at **eulogy** **.** **poured** **a** **dark** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **tannish** **,** **long** **lasting** **head** **with** **good** **lacing** throughout the drink . the aroma was one of malty sweetness and some fruitiness as well . the taste is a complex one with a carbonated malty sweetness with hints of raisins and currants . there is a nice bitter finish that is not strong enough to overshadow the sweetness but balances the taste nicely . it is smooth and creamy in the mouth and i was ready for a second one .
**appearance** **:** **poured** **a** **cloudy** **dark** **amber** **color** **.** the effect of the swirling yeast is really cool ! head was about an inch and **a** **half** **of** **off-white** **foam** , but quickly went away to nothing . smell : pungent bouquet of fruit , mostly pear , and a wisp of alcohol . very enticing . taste : sweet fruity esters and a touch of fusel alcohol . typical belgian flavors , but more robust than , say , leffe . mouthfeel : slightly creamy from the carbonation , with a warming alcohol effect . overall a very smooth beer . drinkability : very tasty and very respectable belgian for a special occasion , but the high abv limits the drinkability of this brew . personally , i think belgians taste so much different from your average beer that i would n't want to drink more than one at a time .
poured into room temp pint glass . i let sit for 10 minutes before drinking . appearance - **a** **very** **light** **brownish** **color** **with** a hint of **orange** **.** **light** head , which settled into a **thin** **layer** **,** **decent** **lacing** . smell - definitely an ipa , by the good amount of floral aroma that hits your nose . also has a piney scent . this is a very pleasant smelling beer . taste - to steal a line from old school 'once it hits your lips , it 's so good ' . seriously though , very strong hop taste , but not entirely bitter . earthy and citrus notes as well . yeasty , as prevalent by the yeast you can see in your glass . mouthfeel - very smooth , low carbonation . drinkability - i could drink a few of these , definitely one of the better ipa 's that i have tasted .
**a** **very** **hazy** **gold** **,** **with** **streaks** of orange and light red running silently through it . very light yet wholesome citrus , primarily lemon which overshadows very subtle and smooth orange peel . very slight vanilla . fairly light and smooth while being a little over carbonated for my liking . slight lemon and very insignificant hints of zestier orange . this is a perfect summer time beer , not much too it , not much to think about , and pretty refreshing . maybe a little too plain for my liking though .
**poured** **a** **light** **amber** **color** **with** **a** **one** **finger** **head** **,** **slight** **lacing** on the glass . mildy sweet with malts and hint of spices . taste is sweet with caramel malts and a slightly bitterness in the end . light and minimal carbonation . pretty decent beer to drink since its not expensive .
st patricks day 'once a year brew ' according to the bottle **.** **pours** **a** **copper/amber** **color** **with** **a** **creamy** **,** **tightly** **packed** **off** **white** **head** **.** **ok** **lace** . not as much of a **reddish** color as i would have thought . aromas of sweet malt , caramel some fruitiness and a nice hop presence . nice grainy sweet malt upfront followed by the caramel and fruit . great balance with an earthy , slightly spicy hop bitterness . seemed a bit thin bodied but had a rich , mildly creamy mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation . alcohol was hidden really well and this was extremely drinkable . anyone for a session irish red
**pours** **a** **nice** **golden** **yellow** **with** **bright** **white** **head** **.** nice hop aroma . i thought the malt body light with a nice hop finish a nice and bitterness . mouthfeel is medium and drinkability good . i could have a few of these-good beer for those transitioning to craft beer .
**well** **,** **being** **a** **stout** **lover** i was intrigued by this offering . cherries seem like a **natural** **pairing** with **a** **stout** . after finishing it , i was more then a little bit **disappointed** . a : poured **as** **black** as the remnants of an ink well ( in my brand new tenth year anniversary ommegang glass by the way ) **.** **no** **head** **whatsoever** and i was a bit aggressive with my pour . s : curiously **devoid** of any real odors . as the beer warmed up , i did detect the faint hint of cherries . t : not that i regularly partake in cold medicine , but this stuff reminded me of nyquil and it only got worse as time passed ( yes , it took a while to finish it off ) . medicinal taste with a sour/bitter finish . m : oily and viscous , it seemed to leave a thin coating on the palate for several minutes after each sip . linked to the less then appealing taste and it was not a pleasant reminder . d : as stated above , this one took awhile to finish off . very disapponted , as bell 's other offerings are pretty good . i would not recommend this stout to anyone ( unless i was angry with them and wanted to see them suffer ) .
**pours** **a** **dingy** **coper** **in** **color** **with** **an** **interesting** **head** **,** **and** **some** **good** **lacing** . the smell is strong with apples and beligan yeast and spices . the taste is reminiscent of the smell with tart apples and an almost wine like quality . the prominent yeast flavor is complex and overall the alcohol is hidden rather well . mouthfeel is not overpowering but in no way watery . overall a grate offering from unibroue .
22 oz bottle into a couple of tulip **glasses** **pours** **black** **(** ruby comes out along the edges **)** **with** **a** **finger** **of** **foamy** **light-mocha** **head** . this maintains some richness to the look **,** **leaving** **back** **frothy** **sticky** **lace** **that** clings to the sides of the glass . the aroma smells floral and citric , with a good bit of chocolate mixed in . roast pushes up from underneath giving this a light crunchiness in the nostrils the taste has an assertive green citric bite , balanced across the back by sweet notes of chocolate and caramel malts . dark roasted coffee character is mostly confined to the finish , where it hangs with some leftover bitter fruit . the mouthfeel is medium bodied and over sharp feeling in the mouth , the whole way through . that 7 % feels about right on target here , giving the body some oomph but still keeping any alcohol warmth at a distance this was a decent take on the style from blue point with a well balanced and fairly easy drinking mix of flavors . i just wish that the overall profiles put a bit more out there for you to wrap your palate around . this seemed a bit muted . i’m not sure if this was because of the age of the bottle or not . i’d be willing to reinvestigate this one .
**a** **:** **near** **black** **body** **with** **creamy** **tan** **head** **.** s : raisins , smoke and coffee primarily . t : the milk shows up strong , adding a sweeter dimension to the already oatmeal raisin chocolate cookie-like flavors . some slight herbal hop along the way . smoke also lingers on the finish . m : creamy with a long finish . d : great balance of sweet and smokey with a smooth body . it 's an easy drinker , full of flavor without being too big at all . the sweet comes from both the fruit and the milk , balancing the acidity on that end as well . really pleasant .
**a** **:** **the** **pour** **reveals** **a** **burgundy-tinged** **hue** **that** **lets** **some** **light** **in** **,** **topped** **by** **a** **one-finger** **head** **that** **stays** around briefly , **but** **dissipates** to a **thin** **layer** of **bubbles** on top . s : malty aroma is large with the smell of toasted malt , toffee , figs , and sharp/sweet alcohol . the bouquet is fairly formidable , with all of these scents coming together nicely , reminiscent of an old ale in smell . t : surprisingly , the malt flavor plays second-fiddle to the sweetness of this beer . while the introduction gives off a decent maltiness , the assault comes in the middle with a sweet , mildly hopped bitter and alcohol taste that pushes toward the finish . aftertaste is of the initial malt and the sugar-like sweetness . m : light-bodied and carbonated adequately for the style they 're attempting . slightly syrupy , as in almost like the cloying sweetness of cough syrup . d : wee heavys are tricky beasts , and this one is no different . honestly , i was n't overly impressed with this one , but still thought it was a valiant effort . the drinkability is not as high with the attack of sweet flavor and the aftertaste it leaves .
had this on-tap at my local **haunt** **pours** **a** **dark** **reddish-brown** **color** **with** **a** **short** **fizzy** **head** . faint toasted malt smell , but couldnt really notice anything else in the aroma . malty , slightly sweet taste with a crisp , dry mouthfeel . couldnt detect much in the hops department . basically this beer was n't bad , but it was n't great either . could use a bit more character . but on the plus side ... it was pretty smooth and drinkable and went well with my steak .
**pours** **a** **murky** **gold** **with** **white** **head** **that** **hangs** around for awhile . the smell is the best part of this beer . a citrus sourness with light caramel tones . the taste is very yeast forward as to be expected . a lemony kinda of quality on the front but the malt quickly comes in and calms the notes from the yeast . i must say though i wish there was a little more flavor from the malt to balance a bit more . not a bad not a great beer . my 3rd beer from this brewery and my least favorite .
**pours** **a** **thin** **dark** **tan** **head** **above** **a** **dark** **brown** **body** **.** **head** **recedes** **fairly** **fast** **.** **little** **lacing** . dark fruits , black cherries dark malts , very boozy . woody , molasses , faint smokiness . some spices , cinnamon ? again with the alcohol . medium mouthfeel . low end of the carbonation spectrum . booze takes the cake on this one for me . a definite sipper . other than that , it was very unique with its wodd flavors . would try again .
**pours** **out** **like** **motor** **oil** **.** **deep** **black** **,** **with** **brown** **edges** **and** **a** **small** **mocha** **colored** **head** **which** **fades** **quickly** **but** **leaves** **lacing** . some small chunkies hang near the bottom . nose is thick vanilla bourbon , with heavy malts and oak alcohol . first sip is burnt charred oak chips , with molasses and dense caramel . more alcohol on warming , and some brown sugar sweetness . very nice . mouthfeel is dense and thick , fitting the taste of the beer . drinkability may be hurt by the abv , but it 's a damn fine beer .
**a** **:** **a** **hazy** **yellow** **with** **at** **frothy** **two** **finger** **head** **.** looks just as it should . s : some lemon zest and perhaps some other spices and fruits . very fresh . t : off the charts ! i get some bready flavors along with a little tartness from what i believe to be lemons . a nice , clean , hoppy taste at the end . m : a little carbonation , slighty creamy , but finishes crisp and smooth . d : very tasty , very easy to drink . i imagine you could throw down quite a few of these in place of your everyday lager .
thanks **goes** out to msubulldog25 for this one **.** **pours** **a** **nice** **clear** **dark** **brown** **color** **,** **nice** **carbonation** **,** **nice** **small** **tan** **creamy** **head** **which** **leaves** **quickly** **,** **some** **lacing** afterwards . the nose is on the light side , roasted malts , and caramel . the taste is very nice though , sweet/malty , slightly roasty , and some nice caramel thrown in . medium body . very drinkable , this is a very tasty oatmeal stout from troegs , i 've enjoyed a few so far and have a few more other 's to try real soon .
**a** **:** **what** **little** **head** **appeared** **was** **gone** in less **than** **a** **minute** **,** **leaving** only the golden-amber liquid to speak for itself s : subdued hop aroma , some malty and grainy notes in the nose that remind me of a subtle english pale t : pale malt flavors come first , with the hops right on its heels , making for a marginally bitter middle and finish . lots of grain throughout , with the hops taking on a kind of grassy character . this is especially noticed at the very end m : some hop oil texture , dry and bitter feel in the aftertaste that coats the palate all over d : enough flavor to be commendable , but as far as a great pale ale goes , this one does n't quite cut it . frankly , i think some of the styles many see as 'basic ' can be the hardest to perfect , and i 'm by no means deriding the brewery . i just feel that this one may need more work .
**a-** **pitch** **black** **color** **,** **non-transparent** **,** **half** **finger** **thick** **dark** **brown** **head** that lowered to a **thin** **cover** **s-** **dark** **chocolate** , creamy , sweet , oats , dark malts , hints of vanilla t- roasted coffee beans , smokey , sweet chocolate , earthy , milky , caramel malts m- medium/heavy body , medium carbonation , smooth , slight dry smokey fizz then turns to a faint oily finish d- worth buying again ( and again and again ) this is a nice full bodied oatmeal stout . nice smokey feel w/ good flavors to compliment . this ranks near the top of my favorite stouts .
**pours** **a** **dense** **,** **opaque** **black** **body** **with** **a** **creamy** **,** **khaki** **colored** **head** that is very slow to **dissolve** **to** **a** **thin** **lacing** . robust aromas of roasted malt and chocolate float from the glass with dark fruits appearing as it warms . chocolate aromas permeate at the close the flavor is quite good featuring a nice blend of roasted malt , milky chocolate and hints of dark fruit such as cherry or plum . as it warms the roasted aspects become more dominant medium carbonation with a full body and roasted finish . nice imperial stout , on the roasted side but lacking some of the hop traits i would expect in the american double stout version .
**amber** **colored** **with** **some** **ruby** **hues** **.** **huge** **erupting** **head** **of** **off** **white** **fades** **into** **some** **sticky** **lace** . nice looking just a bit overcarbonated . oaky wood galore . bursting with fresh wood aromas . hints of caramel , alcohol , earth , honey , tropical fruits and hints of vanilla . just huge on wood . very tasty treat with a great mouthfeel from the wood adds a wonderful tannic quality . much more neutral wood in the mouth . still a great oaky wood induced quality but much more vanilla shows through , a bit toasty , with great cereal malts and grains . burstng with toffee , caramel , and coconut . some other tropical falvors not necesarrily fruit ? good carbonation and great mouthfeel smooth and creamy . a beer very easy drinking and no traces of the high abv .

picked up a six pack of this in jacksonville , illinois **.** **nice** **brown** **label** . **a** **:** **nice** **dark** **appearance** **,** **with** **a** **nice** **two** **finger** **head** s : very good roasted , malty aroma . t : nice and smooth malty caramel flavor . very good flavor . m : good . d : good beer overall , good example of an oatmeal stout .
**lightly** **greenish** **yellow** **clear** **appearance** **with** **some** **upwelling** **bubbles** **.** **no** **real** **head** generation , but a couple of plimsoul line rings mark the sips . astringent cidery aroma , some sense of tanin-like pops . pretty much what you smell is what you get , plenty of white grape , maybe a touch of a crab apple jelly sweetness and an overall wine-like impression . slightly dryish finish , not a lot of honey-influence as i was expecting . not my style to be sure , though some of the thicker mead-like beers like dogfish head midas touch are sometimes more up my alley .
**consumed** **feb** . 7th , 2010 at stone world bistro **.** **fairly** **clear** **medium** **coppery** **hue** **with** **ruby** **highlights** **.** **fine** **,** **nitro-esque** **tan** **head** **provides** **good** **lacing** . aroma is comparable to a fresh stone barleywine , meaning lots of wet herbal hop character and a smallish trace of bready , caramel malt . malt flavors of bread and caramel again remind me of an old guardian , that is until the hops hit . they have no doubt faded a great deal , but there is still an earthy hop character , grassy and citric . oh , and lots and lots of bitterness mouthfeel is quite dry , bordering on parching . this is actually a good thing , considering the big flavors this beer packs . a sipper , to be sure , but this is so similar to a barleywine ( to my palate , at least ) that it makes me wonder where stone is going with this one .
**medium** **bodied** **,** **clear** **orange/amber** **color** **with** **a** **substantial** **ivory** **head** **that** **lingers** well and leaves a bit **of** **lace** aroma is primarily light caramel malt with a touch of floral hops in the background taste is toasty caramel malt , fresh dark bread , toffee , a bit of apple and citrus . a touch of floral hops kicks in at the finish smooth and very drinkable with a bit of alcohol warmth..
**ah** **,** **a** **classic** **barley-wine** . even though there are certainly better , this was my first exposure to the world of barley-wines , so it has some sentimental **value** **.** **clear** **,** **ruby-amber** **in** **color** **with** **a** **dark** **beige** **head** **and** a whipped-egg **consistency** **after** **a** **vigorous** **pour** **.** **head** **thins** **some-what** **but** **never** **disappears** **,** **perched** **atop** **medium-sized** **bubbles** and **medium-light** **carbonation** **.** **lacing** **is** **sparse** . aroma is of a fruity fermentation , metals , sweet amber malts , butterscotch , and some phenolic alcohols . mouthfeel is not as smooth as i prefer , and cloying with a firm , sticky body . taste begins with initially harsh fermentation by-products , fades into a subtle metallic note , some tolerable alcohols , then gives way to the main attraction ... lots of sticky malts with caramelized sugars , raisin and date characters , and ending in a smooth , well-balanced lingering sweetness . a good example of the style but not my favorite . the metals and harsh initial mouthfeel detract from the enjoyment . as the beer warms , the alcohols and mouthfeel simmer , and the malt livens up , making for a much more enjoyable drink . i highly recommend to pour it first , then let it warm up to 55f before drinking it .
**i** 've been **hearing** **lots** of good things about **this** beer , and it just came into town on the start of the new year . had to see what it 's **all** about **.** **pours** **a** **nice** **deep** **amber** **with** **a** **nice** **frothy** **head** **that** lasted just long enough for me to take a few good whiff , then settled down to a ring . has a nice , smooth smell to it , but nothing special . tastes just like it smells . a little tang at the end , but nothing disrupting . it 's just so smooth ... .it just fills your mouth up so nicely , you could really drink this all night with no problem . this is one solid built beer , very drinkable , but nothing extraordinary .
**blue** start **wheat** is really my first delve into wheat **beers** . and thus i do n't have areal basis for comparison for this style , but i truely enjoyed it . a : **pours** **a** **very** **hazy** **,** **pale** **yellow** **with** **a** **bubbly** **white** **head** **.** **low** **retention** **and** **lacing** . s : light aroma . most smells were non-distinguishabe . t : crisp , slightly bitter , but overall very mild . m & d : light to medium mouthfeel and very drinkable . a perfect mid-summers day beer . again , my first real experience with a wheat beer and it was quite enjoyable . i will definitely have this again and wil further explore this style .
**i** was served **this** beer from the tap at the march 21 , 2008 session of the **spring** beer festival in portland , **oregon** . a : **it** **poured** **a** **dirty** **yellow** **colored** **body** **with** **a** **robust** **two** **finger** **off** **white** **head** **that** **had** **decent** **retention** and supported **a** **balanced** **lacing** s : it had aromas of sweet lightly toasted malts , with hints of caramel and the smoll t : it began with sweet caramel malt flavors and creamy yeasty flavors . that was followed by minor citrusy flavors including lemons and oranges . it hid the alcohol well and was a bit thin on many flavors . m : it was a light bodied beer with modest carbonation and a sweet clean finish . d : nice ale but does not stand out as an outstanding beer . good session brew ... .but only one in a crowd .
**the** first of many beers received from beerrun13 in a huge trade . big thanks to him for some great west coast brews i could never get here **.** **very** **nice** **amber** **color-quite** **the** **white** **head** **on** top . low aroma-sort of a nutty , sweet malt smell . toasted malt flavors . somewhat sweet . slighly bitter in the finish . decent enough mouthfeel . above average drinkability but i dont find this as well done as their pale ale . i have a second bottle so will re-think my review when i have that .
i picked this beer up on a whim as i was in the mood **for** **a** **good** **coffee** **stout** and the siren-like figure somehow told me this is the beer for you . a bit **freaky** , but i went with it . i was impressed from the very first **pour** **.** **like** **any** **stout** **,** **the** **color** **is** **a** **dark** **molasses** **black** . **but** **...** **the** **head** **was** **thick** **and** **dense** **with** **good** **retention** . the coffee aroma was intense ! the roasted goodness almost overwhelms my sense of smell . the roasted coffee flavors are the first things that i could taste along with hints of chocolate . however , i can tell there 's more complexity here than my palette can decipher . the coffee flavors bring bitterness but it 's not over powering as the sweetness of the malt cuts the bitterness quite nicely the beer has carbonation but once the bubbles have escaped the beer gives a creamy , velvety feel and finish . the alcohol was very well hidden in this beer which is scary . this is an amazing coffee stout . it is a very drinkable beer as it does not leave your mouth feeling bitter and dry ; it only leaves it wanting more .
thanks grumpy for this extra . bottled in jan 09 and consumed 8 months past ( too long i know , but this is probably the only time i 'll ever try this beer ) . **pours** **very** **dark** **for** **the** **style** **with** **a** **2** **finger** **head** . smell is biscuity malts with caramel , dark fruits , orange , grass , belgian esters . taste is more of a barleywine at this point than a dipa , but i 'm really digging it . it 's not quite balanced considering how huge the malt backbone is compared to the subdued hops , but the flavor is excellent with pronounced caramel , melon , and orange . i would have loved to try this fresh , as it 's a very good beer with some obvious age on it .
**this** **is** **a** **very** **clear** **golden** **colored** **ale** **with** **a** **one** **inch** **white** **head** . its aroma is mostly of yeast with a little spice and wheat . the flavor does not match the aroma at all ; this is much better than i expected judging by the smell . the belgian yeast is apparent and there are slight tones of alcohol and dark fruit . mouth feel is light bodied and highly carbonated . not too shabby .
**poured** **with** **a** **wonderful** **fluffy** **white** **chiffon** **like** **head** **seemed** **as** **if** **whipped** to a light dense sculptured form that hovered over the beer 's surface . by the time i held my glass on high to gaze at the wondrous **libation** **,** **that** **foamy** **fluffy** **froth** **active** **in** **the** glass clung with a certain tenacity gracing the walls with a web **,** **of** **lace** and bubbles .. the room light reflected with **rays** **of** **clear** **golden** **yellow-straw** **color** **,** all the while bubbles materialized and darted to the surface with abandon . i was greeted by a yeasty , sweet nose- undertones of lemon and assorted hints of sweet natural fruity citrus tunneled through the head all the while spreading notes of malted grains . a background of alcohol kept the doors of beer perception cleansed ... . the flavor begins with a slightly sweet manner . after making it 's debut and receding into a bitter hint of a melodious compound of hops and malt -- i ca n't taste the oats , or the wheat or the barley , but their combination builds a wonderful flavor like a suspense novel that prods the reader to turning the pages.-in this case the beer 's flavor prods me to taking sip after sip after.. the finish lingers with a boisterous note of citrus once again- the flavor and character of the beer stayed put upon my palate when enjoying karmeliet tripel , i keep trying to draw the last molecules of this beer from my empty laced glass .
**appearance** **:** **very** **deep** **brown** ( about a 37 srm **)** **,** **finger** **and** **a** **half** **tan** **head** **,** **good** **lacing** , smell : big coffee , cream , very dark chocolate , slight woody , slight dark fruit . taste : clean coffee , cream , chocolate , woody , earthy , coffee bitterness . medium body . tad too strong carb . final thoughts : just a pretty general porter . pretty standard , nothing new , nothing done perfectly . just , porter . i like simple and perfectly done , this is kind below that point . it 's good , but theres better . nice body and a bit more flavor in this one would have made this simple and perfect .
**reviewed** on 8/19/08 . 33 cl bottle **.** **pours** **a** **slightly** **cloudy** **piss** **yellow** **with** **a** **huge** **foamy** **white** **head** **.** aroma of wheat , light fruits . flavor is similar with an initial spicy kick . a bit boozy and leaves a strong warmth in your throat . ok , but nothing special ... . 6/3/7/3/14 ( 3.3/5 )
**this** **stuff** is about as **dark** as **dark** **can** get **...** **almost** **black** **.** **pours** **with** **a** **great** **,** **big** **head** . it smells like it looks , roasted grain i was greeted initially with a vinegar taste . as the sips went by the flavor evened out , but my over all impression is that i 'm sitting here with a slightly over average beer . january 2012 i 'm giving this guy another try . no vinegar taste , i taste good ol ' roasty malt met with just the right balance of hop bitterness and the bitterness you get from charred grain .
back in johnstown , pennsylvania again ... for **business** . had dinner at the boulevard restaurant ... again . this night they had the firestone walker 's reserve robust porter ... .on tap **!** **the** **color** **was** **dark** **amber** **with** **generous** **white** **head** **that** **laced** well . the nose was weak ... hints of malt and caramel . the taste included a rich malt , hints of coffee and earth . the mouthfeel was good thank to the light abv . this beer is worth a taste and definitely a session
**a-** **pours** **a** **staw/gold** **macro** **color** **,** **nice** **foamy** **white** **head** **with** **decent** **lacing** **as** **slowly** **fades** . not the best looking beer i 've seen ... s- huge citrus in the nose - mostly orange , hops as well , a nice smelling ipa t- hops come first followed by large pine notes and small hints of the malt which are then cancelled out by the nice bitter finish . wait to take my next sip m- carbonation is good , lighter side of medium , real easy drinking beer . some good dryness left in the mouth ... even at 8.2 abv it feels like a beer i could session ... watch out o- not a 'great ' dipa , but certainly very good . has a good nose and some depth in flavor while continuing to remain hoppy and bitter ( which is how i like it ) , carbonation and mouthfeel are good and since it is fairly local i can get them fresh which makes it all the better.certainly a brew that i would buy in a 6 pack 'b+ '
had **this** **in** a small sniffer , which i found was **absolutely** **perfect** for the style ... thanks for the tip rob from smokeless ! **pours** **a** **sinister** **black** **with** **a** **dark** **brown** **head** **that** **vanishes** **rather** **quickly** **but** **leaves** **a** **black** **ale** with **red** edges in the light . aroma was roasted malts , chocolate , coffee , rather earthy like most rogues i have tried . taste was a dry bitterness , coffee , dark chocolate , ridiculously long finish , fantastic . very rish mouthfeel , syrupy and smooth . dangerously drinkable , and very potent . good show rogue as always !
**pours** **an** **effervescent** **mahogany** **with** **a** **finger** **of** **mocha** **colored** **head** **.** **average** **head** **retention** **&** **lacing** s : dark fruit & weird juicy fruit scents t : carob , dark fruittyness , a touch of iron , oaky dryness , leafy hops & booze up front . dryness , a somewhat annoying chocolate covered cherry taste as this warms , along with faint figgyness & more leafy hops as this warms , along with a faint hint of juicy fruit . finishes dry with more carob & weird juicy fruit taste , verging on the edge of drain pour , maybe i should 've had this cold mf : slick , kind of watery fairly noticable/ prickly carbonation drinks okay , a half hearted attempt at the style imo . my first imp stout homebrew was so much better , even weaker than the imp pilsner & ipa . so many good/great riss out there , sorry i wasted my time on this one
**a** **-** **poured** **a** **dark** **reddish** **brown** **that** **produced** **a** **sulte** **tan** **head** **that** **retained** **well** **and** **left** **good** **lace** around the glass s - hops and malts are bold , with some light fruits and brown sugar t - hoppy upfront , some malty backbone , sweet brown sugar and gingerbread m - smooth , medium bodied , mildly carbonated d - very good beer , my introduction to stone , and this is something i ca n't wait to enjoy during saints games , happy or sad
**i** **love** **dogfish** **beers** , but i ca n't say i feel this one at all . in fact , out of all the **dfh** **beers** i 've had , this one stands out as my least favorite it **pours** **a** **pretty** **pale** **amber** **color** **and** it smells really good . it 's a very unique smell - lots of spice and a whole lot going on . however , this definitely does not translate to great taste . i thought this beer tastes like it has way too much going on . i ca n't get a handle on what flavors are supposed to come through and they all end up mixing together in a pretty unmanagable combination for me it has a mouthfeel very similar to a miller lite ( which i do n't think is a real beer ) and overall just does n't work for me . like i said , i am a huge fan of dfh , but i think they missed the mark on this one . but hey , the girl i date likes it , so maybe it 's just me .
**pours** **a** **hazy** **orange/yellow** **with** **a** **creamy** **white** **head** **,** **amazing** **retention** **and** **lacing** . had mine with no lemon this time . big aromas of clove , spice , banana , with some faint hops in the tail as well . flavors are heavy on banana , clove , cardamom , with a surprising representation of malt and hops . good mouthfeel and perfect carbonation . it has all the elements of a classic weiss beer but enough flavors in there to remind you of the malt and hops . highly quaffable . this is just a great hefe , nuff said .
**a** bit of a disapointment in that this porter **tastes** **very** **similarly** **to** **their** **brown** ale that i had earlier . the roasted malt character is greater in the porter , but other than that , it 's the same beer -- taste-wise . the beer is a bit thin and **watery** , thus lacks creaminess , boldness , and never becomes characterful . this was acceptable with the lighter **brown** ale , but i expect more from **porters** . **it** **looks** **like** **a** **brown-er** **cola** **with** **light** **carbonation** **and** **lacking** **head** **retention** **.** smells caramel malty and mildly roasty . modesty chocolate / coffee notes pepper the beer slightly , but not enough to make a meaningful impact . thin and weak in the body with a mild yeastiness . finishes slight of grainy , but fairly clean .
**i** got **this** brew in a trade with wasatch , thanks john 22oz bottle served in a goblet **.** **l** **-** **clear** **,** **red/orange** **color** **with** **a** **beige** **head** **that** **thinned** after time . s - sweet caramel malt aroma . t - sweet toffee/caramel upfront with dark fruit bitterness coming through near the finish . f - medium bodied with mild carbonation . d - a decent sipper .
**this** **beer** **pours** **a** **dark** **brown** **,** **almost** **black** , w/ light slightly permeating through to show an **almost** **bronze** **color** **.** **one** **finger** **of** **cream** **white** **head** **and** **nice** **,** **sustaining** **lace** . i can smell a blend of coffee and vanilla ... smells sweet . the taste is a rush of flavor w/ hops up front . this beer is not bitter at all and is extremely refreshing . i would prefer a bit less carbonation ... would love to try this one on tap . i can taste roasted malts , coffee , caramel and fig with a slight alcohol taste . the mouthfeel is real nice . smooth , yet the flavors linger on the tastebuds this is one fairly complex brown ale ... mild enough to please the masses , yet offering more to those who expect it ... thanks dogfish
a ceramic 750ml bottle of the 2008 vintage that was shared at an impromptu tasting . poured into a tulip glass . the pour is **syrupy** and thick . i can tell that this is going to be thick just from watching it pour . the **body** **is** **garnet** **amber** **accentuated** **by** **ruby** **highlights** in the light . **there** **is** **ample** **head** **,** **and** **it** **leaves** **spotty** **lacing** . swirls produce wine-like legs that creep back into the beer . the aroma is dominated by boozy warmth , caramel , nutty malts , and a hint of vanilla . the taste is similar , but more complex . caramel , toffee , and some nuttiness is joined by piney hops . cherry notes also make a quick appearance before they give way to vanilla in the finish . thick , sticky , and syrupy , this has a lot of potential , but i would hold onto another one for a couple more years before opening it , to give it more time to mellow .
a 750 ml corked and caged bottle with foil around the mouth . i bought this at liquid solutions over a year ago , so i am hoping that the hops have held up . a : the ale opened with a slight pop . a pour into my **mug** **yielded** **a** **2** **finger** **swatch** **of** **foamy** **head** **that** **has** **clung** precariously **to** **the** sides . the ale is **a** **darker** **amber** **color** **,** showing off **hints** **of** **copper** **red** **.** **haziness** throughout the glass **dulls** the color a bit . s : the nose has a thick vinous aroma punctuated with some oily hops and an alcohol aroma that does n't hide its strength . t : it seems that my fears have been realized . the hops have settled down significantly , casting a muted flavor in the mouth . the barrel aging has imparted a sweeter flavor to the ipa , adding some vanilla bean flavors and a sweet white grape flavor . graininess overtakes the last half of the sip and , in conjunction with the chardonnay profile , creates a sweet mouthfeel that could pass for a belgian ipa . m : the mouthfeel starts off promising , hits some belgian ipa notes midway through but never really hits the hoppy notes that i was hoping to see . interesting but not extraordinary . d : the abv is high but there is a large flavor profile that keeps the tastebuds interested . worth a look for its uniqueness .
**inviting** **copper** **color** **with** **a** **sticky** **,** **if** **thin** **,** **head** . caramel and apricots in the nose . wheat , dried apricots , caramel , and a dry finish . some lingering banana , too . the hops provide a late , but pronounced character . pretty tasty . i would n't say it 's as outstanding as others from southern tier like pumking and creme brulee stout , though
**pours** **a** **very** **cloudy** **yellow** **,** you can pass light through it easily but you ca n't see through it . very strongly smelling beer , smells of spices and a bit of banana . tastes mildly sweet and a bit tart . prominent banana and spice taste . many different levels of taste to this , has some malt and vanilla flavors too . hops shows up for the party too . this is one of the quality beers with many complex flavors and every sip is different . it is closer to a 4.75 in taste . mouthfeel is very good . very drinkable .
on tap **at** **the** **sunset** **.** **presented** **hazy** **,** **light** **gold** **,** **with** **a** **merange** **,** **white** **head** **.** **exceptional** **retention** **,** **ring-like** **lacing** all the way to the bottom . aromatics are lively , zesty , and enticing . phenols with spice and fruit . coriander , orange peel , cardamon , and some slight cracked pepper accent the triple- type nose . some slight tartness is in the background , a shadow behind the bubblegum and spice . nose finishes with warming zest and vanilla . lightish body , crisp and snappy , with creamy carbonation . pallet starts off with some wheat tartness and husky zest . as the brew warms , it shows itself to closely resemble a double white , with triple-like character . well integrated citrus , clove , and lemon zest , work well with a bannana accent . finishes warming , crisp , and soft . extremely well balanced and drinkable , possibly the best brooklyn offering i 've tried .
**medium** **amber** **color** **,** **small** **head** . a medium bodied amber ale . nicely malty and slightly hoppy . a mild yet full flavored ale . rich , smooth taste . mouthfeel is full and round . finish is clean and smooth . aftertaste is malty and slightly bitter . nice beer . flavorful , light and refreshing .
**sierra** **nevada** **juniper** **black** **ale** **is** **an** **opaque** **,** **pitch** **black** **ale** with **a** **huge** **,** **fluffy** **,** **lumpy** **,** **light** **brown** **head** **that** **has** **incredible** **longevity** **and** **leaves** **clumps** **of** **foam** on the glass . the aroma is grassy and hoppy . it seems a little muted by the head , but it 's still strong . there is a note of resiny sweetness . it 's medium bodied and quite smooth . the finish is dry and leaves the tongue a little dusty . it tastes a little bit sweet and quite bitter . the juniper is really prominent and it 's backed by resiny pine and ashy roast . this has a lot of flavor . this setting works really well for the juniper . the aftertaste is drier and has more dark roast . this is a bold beer in many ways . it looks , smells and tastes like a beer lover 's beer . outstanding brew
**multiple** attempts at a hard **pour** **all** **fail** to yield **anything** **but** **a** **slight** **and** **still** **incomplete** **head** **on** **this** **rust-amber** **colored** **beer** . i even tried , unsuccessfully , to produce **a** head by swirling the beer around and then pouring it from a first glass to a second one . **no** **noticeable** lacing . initially the nose is mildly floral , with hints of lemon zest and bubblegum , but it becomes a bit sour as the beer warms . the taste of this brew was disappointing . an initial hoppy bitterness is familiar and appropriate for an ipa , but the dry finish is too sharp and astringent , with some lingering smokey and ash-like earthy notes that seem harsh and out of place note : although it 's possible that i 've simply gotten ahold of a bad batch , i should note that this six-pack was purchased from the refridgerated section of a large and respectable store , in a well-populated area within an hour 's drive from the brewery .
**a** **couple** of ( generous ) samplers . it now seems as if this is to be the replacement of the downtown **honey** **brown** beer at olde main ( since late spring 2006 ) . **clear** and light-straw in appearance , yet **not** **entirely** **devoid** **of** **color** **.** **smells** like ... not much -- maybe a hint of malts , hops , and/or grasses -- but at least it 's not obnoxious . taste-wise , it 's something like a watered down czech pilsner . light-bodied and relatively smooth . about as drinkable as water . brewed with care ... but not for discriminating customers . according to bar personnel , this is olde main 's in-house alternative to miller lite , etc . granted , it 's much better than such swill , but that does n't mean it 's any good . basically if you 're reading beeradvocate.com , you 'll have no interest in having a pint of this .
**i** actually **avoided** this for **a** long time , **because** **the** **label** **looks** **like** album art from a bad 80 's metal band . once poured , it **'s** **beautiful** **.** **golden** **color** with a **cascade** of carbonation **,** **and** **a** **thick** **pillowy** **head** . the smell is great , with a rich spiciness and some cedar and a trace of hops . the taste is also nicet , with a banana flavor stepping forward as it warms . unfortunately , the taste score was affected by the fact the hops are too prevalent , especially for the style . a little more time in the bottle would n't hurt , but it 's a fine tasting beer with a pleasant but unremarkable mouthfeel . drinkable , certainly , but wo n't find it 's way onto my desert island list .
**pours** **a** **nice** **orange** **amber** **with** **a** **thin** **white** **head** . mostly some light malts in the nose and i did n't detect much else going on . flavors had a lot of malt and some orange citrus flavors . crisp and bitter to the taste . some other rather fruity and nutty notes that i ca n't quite detect exactly what they are . a bit bubbly but not in a bad way .
**a** **:** **dark** **amber** **with** **an** **offwhite** **head** **.** s : phenols , red berries , malt , fudge , sweetness . t : bitterness , malt , hops , metallic tone . hint of honey in the aftertaste . m : low carboration , medium body . just the way a bitter should be , but perhaps a bit 'thin ' . d : goes down really easy . and with an abv of 3,4 % , you could drink a considerable amount of it without getting too cocky .
i bought a single bottle of this at capone 's restaurant in norristown , **pa** and poured it into a pint glass . appearance : **it** **poured** **a** **deep** **ruby** **colored** **body** **,** **almost** **brown** **,** **with** **a** **light** **tan** **head** **on** **top** **.** **the** **head** was really **tight** **and** **had** **great** **retention** , but did **n't** **leave** **much** **lace** . smell : the aroma was mostly malty , caramel , with a noticeable backbone of spicy hops . taste : a bit watery but all and all dominated by the spicy hops . mouthfeel : nice and crisp . drinkability : good , but not great . do n't drink and review .
reviewed from notes poured from a 22oz bomber , into **highball** glass ... ( sigh ) should 've brought my own glassware on vacation . **pours** **a** **crystal** **clear** **yellow** **.** **big** **,** **fluffy** **head** **,** **recedes** to a **persistent** **layer** of fuzz on top . smell is certainly a blend of the styles , but surprisingly to me , the belgian yeast overpowered the hop elements . taste - i had initially hoped for 75 % ipa , 25 % belgian , i got the reverse and was still quite pleased . front end is very tripel-esque , but the back-end hops continue to creep in and keep the palate off balance overall , nice mash-up , very glad i got to try it .
presentation : comes in a green , 50 cl **can** with the jenlain logo , a description of the beer in a number of languages , and large text describing 'pur malt .

fresh 12oz bottle of the 2011 vintage poured into a **dfh** **pint** glass . a - **pours** **a** **clear** **,** **dark** **copper** **with** **a** **huge** **creamy** **head** **of** **slightly** **off-white** **foam** that hangs around for some time **,** **leaving** **soapy** **lacing** as it **eventually** **dissipates** . s - sweet caramel malt and fresh , pungent hops with just the slightest whiff of apricots . you can tell this is a fresh bottle , the hop aromas are unbelievable t - very similar to the nose , fairly typical dfh ipa flavors of pungent hops and sweet caramel malt , but with a nice amount of apricot flavoring that really comes out in the finish . let 's be honest , this is more or less 60 minute with some apricots added , but it 's a darn tasty spring brew . m - slightly creamy , with a medium mouthfeel and moderate carbonation . d - like i said , this is a great spring-day beer , and i can see myself having many before it disappears from the shelves .
**pours** **a** **clear** **dark** **brown** **brew** . smell is malty with a fruity smell , also has a grassy grainy scent . taste is malty and a bit buttery and bitter . hay and a bit of fruitiness also are in there . mouthfeel is good . a tasty brew , better than regular beck 's , but there are better german brews .
**plain** **gold** **in** **color** **with** **little** **head** . smells like someone dropped a piece of birthday cake frosting in some stroh 's . taste is a bit bland . there 's some light bittering , a mild citrus note , and pretty standard malt . i 'm not picking up any of the spicy or noble hops that should be present in a pilsener . to confuse matters more , the bottle 's label claims this is an ale . mouthfeel is light , and all i really get here is a brew slightly better than the average macrolager . grave ' , since they ask .
on tap **at** **the** **grey** **lodge** . **the** beer **pours** **a** **very** **deep** **,** **dark** **brown** **color** **with** **a** **nice** **thick** **white** **head** **the** aroma of the beer is very complex with definite tones of the spruce in it and spicy notes . the taste is a nice roasted malt base with definite taste from the spruce . it is an odd ingredient to have but i really enjoyed it and would like to try it again . the beer is pretty drinkable but i think i could only have a few in a night . maybe get a bottle or 2 to keep for awhile . thanks to ben franklin .
**i** at first thought i had a bad bottle , but i have tried a couple of others to be sure and i think this is just the way the beer is . and it 's **not** **good** . **pours** **a** **slightly** **hazy** **straw** with a **torrent** of carbonation that **leaves** **a** **fizzy** **,** **weird** **head** the aroma is thin and sour , yeasty and lemony - way lemony . the flavor is super sour , like a fresh lemonade , which is great in lemonade but no so great in a beer . the flavor is cidery , leomony and sour and not pleasant . there is no hop bitterness on the finish . just not a good thing .
**hazy** **amber/orange** **with** **beige** **foam** **composed** **of** **medium** **sized** **bubbles** **.** **very** **good** **head** **retention** **and** **lots** **of** **longlasting** **,** **clumpy** **lacing** . nice aroma , particularly as it warmed - hoppy , malty , and spicy . some earthiness , citrusy grapefruit skin , pine , grassy with a doughy , yeasty sweetness and a bit of pineapple . solid , drying bitterness , some tannins , fruity apple with muted hop notes ( pine and citrus ) . some caramel sweetness . quick finish with some lingering bitterness . medium/full bodied with above average carbonation , very creamy texture and mild warmth . a very pleasant beer with well hidden alcohol and a unique mix of flavours . good stuff
bottle labelled batch # **6** **.** **pours** **a** **copper** **color** **with** **a** **medium** **head** . the aroma was pleasant , as malt , yeast , and grassy tones were present . the flavor was well balanced . yeast , malt and peaches were the dominant flavors , with a tinge of bitterness and citrus zest . smooth mouthfeel , medium body , and very drinkable . the malt and a slight tingling sensation lasts on the tongue for a bit after swallowing . carbonation level was good . overall a nice beer .
**aroma** : **yeasty** **,** **dark** **malts** **.** **appearance** **:** **black** **,** **opaque** **,** **fantastic** **head** **retention** **with** **tiny** **bubbles** . flavor : low malt flavor , mild hops , a little earthy , nice hint of sourness on the foretaste mouthfeel : medium body , low carbonation , creamy aftertaste . very pleasant overall : this is a good mild oatmeal stout , it 's nothing too fancy or out there , but i enjoyed drinking it .
**hazy** **dark** **brownish-orange** **pour** with **fine** bubbles cutting through considerable yeast **sediment** . **topped** **with** **a** **monstrous** **bubbly** **head** **that** **lasts** **several** **minutes** **with** **good** **lacing** . clean , mildly fruity smell understates the amazing taste of this beer . remarkably smooth despite the persistent effervescence . crisp and bitter at the start , with alcohol gaining strength by the end . some fruity notes peek through as the carbonation abates . clean , crisp mouthfeel and strong drinkability , though this one is to be deconstructed and savored slowly .
**poured** into a **goblet** **a** **rich** **dark** **amber** **almost** **brown** **with** **ruby** **highlights** **when** held up to the light . **there** **was** **a** **beautiful** **two-finger** **head** **that** was **slow** **diminish** **and** **left** **great** **lacing** on the glass . the aroma was very strong of cherries and carbon-dioxide , almost like cheerwine ! taste was absolutely wonderful . the vibrant cherry flavor was accented with a complex malt flavor and very subtle hops that were almost unnoticeable , but they did their job . this beer was vibrantly carbonated , once again , almost feels like cheerwine in the mouth . it is very hard to tell that this is 9.8 % alcohol . i 'd have to say , this is almost certainly my favorite beer made with fruit . very enjoyable any time of year .
12 oz . bottle poured into a nonic . **pours** **a** **complete** **midnight** **black** **with** **a** **nice** **tan** **two** **finger** **head** **that** **quickly** **dies** **down** to a **thin** **layer** . **stickenss** **is** **decent** **,** **spotty** here and there . smell is a sweet milk chocolate mixed with a nice toasted oat aroma ... lots of malt in the nose . taste is a bit weak . not a whole lot of flavors there . basically coffee flavors from start to finish . not complex by any means . mouthfeel is fairly light for the style with mild carbonation . creamy and smooth . pretty easy to put down but there are definitely better oatmeal stouts out there .
**pours** **a** **decent** **head** ( about **a** finger and a half ) considering the alcohol percentage . body is fairly **opaque** and is **orange** to **amber** . smells lightly of hops , plus some alcohol and malt . flavor starts off really sweet , then finishes with hoppy notes and a bit of a wine-like quality . definitely not as hoppy as i was expecting , but that 's ok here ; the flavors work together pretty well . it seems really smooth , especially given the amount of alcohol in it ( there 's definitely a nice warming note ) . overall , it 's not something i 'd be likely to get again soon , especially given the price , but it 's still decently tasty ( though it verges on being too sweet at times ) .
**lightly** **murky** **butterscotch** **.** **the** **massive** **head** **is** **ecru** **in** **color** **with** **a** **yellowish** **tint** **and** **looks** to have the **consistency** **of** **an** **excellent** **lace** maker . fooled again ; an underwhelming number of smallish chunks end up on the glass while a stiff **mesa** **of** **foam** sits defiantly in the center of the glass , refusing to fall lower than a few fingers . clove is the first aroma that i notice , but there are others present as well , including fermented apples and pears with an underlying mustiness , hay and a hint of white pepper . the beer has a pleasant flavor with a mild sourness and a clove-like yeastiness that marks it as a belgian . or in this case , a belgian-style ale the spicy fruitiness lasts the longest , but is n't as supported as it could be due to the light body . for that reason , rare vos is more subtle than many of its style brethren . it fades from modestly sweet early to modestly dry late and leaves the palate clean . the light , airy , well-carbonated mouthfeel makes drinking easy and burping frequent . i like rare vos marginally more than i liked 'ommegang squared ' , but it is n't great beer in my mind . it is n't overly complex and the flavor profile does n't push my buttons all that hard . i 'm still glad that i gave it a try .
on-tap at **tustin** **a** **:** **the** **pour** **is** **a** **dark** **amber** **color** **,** bordering **on** **mahogany** **with** **a** **finger** **'s** **worth** **of** **slightly** **off-white** **head** **.** s : wow , the nose on this beer is phenomenal . tons of vanilla , bourbon , maple syrup , brown sugar , caramel , and toffee provide a wonderful sweetness . some miscellaneous dark fruit notes and chocolate fill in the background of the aroma . t : the flavor is similarly impressive . lots of sweet , rich vanilla , bourbon , and oak accompanied by toffee , caramel , brown sugar , and maple syrup . the finish is all that prevents this from a perfect score as there is a bit of alcohol and heat , but there are some nice hints of chocolate . m : the mouthfeel is smooth , creamy , rich , and full bodied . a light but nearly perfect level of carbonation . d : i was told this beer was good , but i had to see for myself . this is one of , if not the , best barrel aged barleywines i 've come across . i might go back again soon to have some more .
**2007** **(** **2-3** yr old bottle ) courtesy **of** **bulletrain76** **a** **:** **completely** **black** **w/tan** **head** **s** : choc. , oak , smoke , licorice t : roasty , coffee , chocolate , oak , alcohol warming . m : very smooth and full throughout d : good and balanced especially for high abv overall : a classic . a couple years really melds flavors together . hard to say which is better , but with a little age definitely more drinkable .
**very** **dark** **for** **the** beer style **,** **dark** **brown** beer that ca n't pass enough light to **see** **the** **clarity** **with** **a** **good** **brown** **colored** **head** . quite fruity and spicy smelling , ginger and clove on dried raisins and prunes . brown sugar and raw apple with a bit of cake batter malt aroma but the spice tries to hide it . the taste starts out sweetened prunes and coffee with the aftertaste of clove . strong coffee flavors here as if this was 50 % stout . strong bitterness for the style , more than a little hop . mouthfeel is ok . an ok beer but i did n't find this to be memorable .
from **notes** **.** **pours** **black** **,** **thick** **tan** **fluffy** **head** **,** **great** **retention** **,** **thick** **lacing** , very active . smell rich , sweet , malty , chocolate , maple , booze , faintly roasty . taste roasted barley and malty sweetness are prominent and well balanced . hints of chocolate and coffee , very mild bitterness , and some booze . feel soem fiz , rich full bodied texture , alc warming , clean finish . overall smooth , rich , complex . very good . a special tasty treat .
**my** first brew from tröegs sent as an extra from mdfb79 , thanks dan . **pours** **a** **nice** **dark** **honey** **orange** **with** **a** **nice** **frothy** **off-white** **head** **.** the nose is nice and hoppy , floral and citrus notes are pretty prevalent . just a bit of sweetness to . very nice flavors , big citrusy hop characters that are nicely balanced out by sweet malt . nice mouthfeel , very crisp , bitterness at the back of the mouth lingers for a pretty long time . good overall brew , i wish i could find it in florida
**i** know i committed a faux **pas** , but poured this from a 11.2 oz bottle into a pint glass ; however , i do n't think it overly affected my impression of it . anyway , the beer poured **a** **light** **caramel** **color** **and** **had** **no** **head** **and** **virtually** **no** **lacing** . it looked kind of thin too . the smell was amazing- dark fruit , caramel , malty but a bit boozy too . of course with 14 % alcohol you probably should expect that . the beer was crazy sweet with caramel and figs coming through to me . despite it appearing to be thin the beer had a nice thick coating mouthfeel and a bit of carbonation , so it was n't totally like drinking syrup . i do n't think i could do more than one of these in a sitting , but definitely worth a try if you 're into big sweet , malty , beers
**shared** from a growler the day it was purchased from the **brewery** **a** **:** **cloudy** **orange** **color** **w/** **frothy** **head** t : oak definitely comes through and then the hops . i love it . an interesting beer , but damn good . o : glad i got a chance to try this and will be looking for more of it to be released at the brewery .
**pours** **a** **rich** **creamy** **head** **that** **lingers** **then** **fades** **to** **a** **clinging** **ring** on the glass . **rich** **golden** **blonde** **color** **,** **tight** **effervesent** **bubbles** **.** **rich** **malty** **aroma** laced with hints of spicey noble hops . sweet malty taste accented by a nicely balanced hop flavor . finishes with a crisp sweetness that is unmistakably honey . mouthfeel and body are a little lacking due to the honey .
**pours** **black** **withone** **finger** **tan** **head** **.** smell - coffee , hint of chocolate , alcohol . taste - definately coffee , not sure if it 's cappuccino or not , dark chocolate , roasted malts . alcohol hidden pretty well . rich and smooth , creamy , very good beer . it 's drinkable for abv . would definately have it again .
bought this from south bay drugs and liquor . served cold , probably too cold , which one should take into consideration while reading this ... **poured** **a** **murky** **,** **lake-mud** **brown** **,** **caramel** edges when held to the **light** **,** **slowly** **forming** **head** **with** **a** **short-lived** but **impressive** **cascade** **resulting** **in** **a** **finger** **of** **tan** **foam** not too much here , serving temp might have something to do with it , the usual caramel and raisin of a wee heavy , sweet wine scent overwhelming chewy raisin flavor , if concentrate really hard , capped with a scotch ale smokiness some nice chewy body that finishes closer to watery it was difficult to finish this one , a little to sweet , probably my last one
**a-** **pours** **a** **deep** **red/amber** **.** **head** was **a** **thin** **finger** that did n't persist all that well but left **some** **wisps** **of** **lacing** . s- slight toast and lots of pine and resiny hop aromas . slight bit of eh ... special herb ' aroma in there as well . t- definitely hop forward . starts with pine/resin hop flavor with notes of tropical fruit . slight caramel malt . a bit of a strange finish . slightly medicinal . not terrible but just a bit disjointed . m- medium body , on the dry side . d- a solid ipa that i could definitely revisit and have a few of without any problem .

12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass - a - **pours** **a** **transparent** **,** **pale** **golden** **color** **.** **the** head is **pale** **white** with **no** **cream** , one finger 's **height** **,** **and** **abysmal** **retention** . i looked away for a few seconds and the head was gone s - stale cereal grains dominate . hardly any other notes to speak of . very mild in strength t - sharp corn/grainy notes throughout it 's entirety . watery , and has no hops characters or esters to be found . very simple ( not surprisingly ) m - highly carbonated and crisp on the front with a smooth finish d - yes , it is drinkable , but there are certainly better choices , even in the cheap american adjunct beer category . hell , at least drink original coors .
**dark** **amber** **and** **crystal** **clear** **.** **impressive** **head** **that** **recedes** **in** **a** **rocky** **fashion** **,** **leaving** **rings** **of** **chunky** **lace** on the glass . nice blend of crystal malt and fresh hop . there 's a mild fruitiness to aroma ... in an attractive way . creamy flavor with a small amount of sweetness . this is quickly lost in a hop bomb rush . this continues through the swallow and long into the aftertaste . the body is surprisingly thin , but it does not take away from the powerful flavors . could be described as a weak-bodied dipa .
**on** **tap** **.** **pours** **a** **black** **color** **with** **a** **thin** **head** **.** **lots** **of** **lacing** . aromas of smoke , roasted malts and some coffee . flavor shadows the aroma . alot of smoke upfront among with some malts and coffee . a bit thin in the mouthfeel department but damn tasty . overall its a good smokey brew worth a second look .

**mostly** **clear** **(** **just** **a** **slight** **haze** **)** **dark** **golden** **color** . this beer is interesting , but not particularly good . its aroma is a mix of blueberry cereal and wheat malt . it 's a grainy , cereal-like , dryish smell . the blueberry is prominent , but seems artificial . the taste is semi-sweet , with the berry flavor consistent throughout . nearly no bitterness . medium-low heft , with an simple finish . slight acidity creeps in at times , but it 's definitely a secondary characteristic in this beer
bought at marché du boisé ( boul . des forges , t-r ) , 6/11/03 , stored **cool** **dark** , 2600 miles in my trunk . **a** **big** **,** **coarse** **,** **cream-colored** **head** **sits** **on** **a** **clear** **,** dirty-gold **beer** . **lots** of fast carbonation . the smell is sweet , malty , lagery . a touch of metal in the lagery , sweetish front . corn syrup middle leads to a bitter , dry finish . it 's a decent lager , but nothing awesome . the corn syrup reminds me of an na .
had **this** at **bocktown** with wvbeergeek and jasonm , came in a 750ml caged and corked the corked banged out of **sight** as soon as the cage was undone . seved into a tulip glass between the **3** **of** **us** **hazy** **,** **deep** **copper** **,** **mahagony** , hard to get a really good look at the color at bocktown **.** **off** **white** head hard to pour without a glass **full** **of** **fluffy** **everlasting** **head** **.** left **lot** **of** **thick** **webbing** all over the inside of the glass **,** **sticky** looking . great aroma ca n't seem to keep it away from the nose . sweet , dark , tart fruit notes , some sour cherry , earthy , spicy , with hints of currants , clove , allspice also nutty , with some belgium yeast . lots of sweet booziness from the start , vinious , dark fruityness with plum notes . the fruittyness was remisent of dried fruit.lots of spicyness lots of clove.also nutty and earthy . finished clean , spicy and very sugary . syrupy , big full mouthfeel , smooth and very creamy with lots of juicyness . a beer to sip , but very enjoyable , wish i had the whole bottle to drink would be no problem . a must try beer if you like this style . seems like a beer that would age very well .

( to me in ma ) i 'd like to see what some time would do with this . i think some sweet maltiness could really come through .

**one** **of** my **favorite** ipa 's **poured** **a** **light** **amber** **,** **cloudy** **orange** **with** **dashes** of gold , completed **by** **a** **full** **head** **of** **white** **foam** **.** **leave** **considerable** **lacing** throughout the drink . beautiful aroma of citrus and floral hops . taste is very interesting ; big time apricot sweetness then boom ! , a crash of hops of refined design . the hops are so clean and crisp you can almost feel your tongue crackle . perfect carbonation and no alcohol in the flavor . aftertaste is of light fruit and bitter hops , but finishes without approaching the disastrous realm of metallic hop-aftertaste . a nice one ...
750 ml . bottle , corked and caged . 2007 bottle conditioned ' **pours** **a** **slightly** **hazy** **dark** **chestnut** **body** **with** **copper** **highlights** **and** **an** **orange** **glint** **.** **the** **frothy** **tan** **head** **holds** **remarkably** **well** **and** **leaves** **craggy** **rings** **of** **lace** with each sip the nose is clearly smoky , expressing beechwood , amidst a sweet , bready , toasty , and caramelish maltiness . in the mouth it 's medium-full and lightly creamy with a very fine-bubbled , natural , median carbonation that leaves it smooth and easy to drink . the flavor is as the nose suggests , with a good amount of smokiness , but not soo much that it 's overdone . it works well to complement the maltiness , and lends an overall depth to the beer that would otherwise not be possible as it enhances the complexity of the malt . some floral and spicy hops make an appearance at the swallow , and it finishes dry . surprisingly , the smokiness does n't build on the palate in a negative way . it lingers , but very nicely . really nicely done . quite enticing in its balance and complexity . certainly worth seeking out for fans of beechwood smoked malt - one of the best i 've had
**anytime** i see an offering from north coast i have n't sampled its a no brainer to put it into the **stable** . this reminds me to make a point of planning a trip north for some great breweries **soon** pour is **easily** **manageable** **,** **forms** **a** **big** **brown** **head** **that** **is** **meaty** **,** **chunky** **and** **clings** to the glass , dries and forms crispies ... damn nice , near perfect . lots of coffee , burnt aroma . comes across with a nice woody burnt flavor that has a counterpunch of bitter hops . bitterness is on the high end of the scale for a stout and it works well . charred taste lingers a bit and gives it a dry finish . some chalkiness but nothing to hold back a fine brew another winner from a fine brewery .
**a** **:** **dark** **pour** **,** pretty **much** **black** **with** **a** **light** **brown** **head** **that** **looks** **pretty** nice for being higher abv . s : oak is very evident . bourbon , chocolate , molasses , vanilla and dark malts . smells pretty good . t : oaky , chocolatey and bourbon are the main flavors . a bit of roasted malt , vanilla and molasses too . a touch of hops can be found near the finish . bourbon flavor shows itself more in the finish . a bit rough around the edges , but still good . m : body is a bit light for being a big beer . a tad creamy . lower carbonation d : pretty good for being a barrel aged high abv ale . not sure what the age is on this one , but it seems fairly fresh since the bourbon flavors are still very evident and a bit powerful . by far , this is got ta be the best offering from cold spring brewery .
**a** **:** **pours** **a** **somewhat** **hazy** **golden** **orange** **hue** **with** **a** little **bit** **off** **white** **head** **which** **recedes** to a small **pool** that **sticks** around for awhile s : a lot of citrus with this one , mostly some grapefruit , a hint of pine and just a dash of herbal spicyness . slightly sweet from the malts but mostly as assault of hop essence . t : grapefruit mostly with a bit of mintyness/menthol , some sweetness from the malt shines through as well . lingering grapefruit aftertaste m : smooth mouthfeel with good carbonation . not watery at all and not excessively thick . a bit drying initially after the swallow but quickly turns juicy . o : a top tier ipa from stone brewing co . an excellent example of the style and a well done beer .
poured into my sam adams **perfect** pint glass . a **was** **a** **clear** **orange** **staw** **color** **with** **a** **1** **finger** **white** **head** **.** s this smelled like a cherry pie coming out of the oven , with the strong tart cherry filling and wheat crust , no wonder my wife calls this a cherry pop tart . t & m the cherries blended very well with the wheat malt making it lightly tart yet very refreshing . the beer held it carbonation well which also gave this beer more of the souring effect you would want in a fruit beer that i never realized before . d this is a good summertime beer for those who enjoy fruit beers with a sourness to them , but do n't want to spend the extra money on the richer belgian fruit beers . i enjoyed it . after reading some of the other reviews , i really believe you have to drink this beer out of the perfect pint glass from sam adams to really appreciate this beer .
**appearance** **:** it 's not as red as **some** **other** red ale 's , it 's more of **a** **dark** **amber** . smell : smells a little bitter , any hoppy . taste : initially have a nice sweet flavor , followed up with a mildly bitter aftertaste . feel : very smooth . drinkability : it 's a great session beer especially when out at a pub with friends .
**the** first time i tried **this** beer out of the bottle i was suppised at it . **the** **pour** **definatly** **doesnt** **look** **like** **a** **traditional** **white** **ale** but that is where the discrepincy stops . the smell has the traditional spice to it . corriander comes to the top , something familiar but yet not able to nail it down . it feels like an old friend . the mouth feel is just about right , effervecent as a wheat should be but not too over the top . and drinkable , you bet . refreshing but not heavy as some wheats can be . it is almost a summer beer but at the same time would be nice on a cold winters nite by the fireside not that i would remember what that is like living in hawail for the past 11 years .
on tap at the brewpub ( ackk , **fish** out **the** **lemon** **slice** **)** **...** **cloudy** **,** **hazy** **pineapple** **color** **(** not as thick as some **)** **,** **decent** **1/4** **inch** **pale** **white** **head** **of** two primary **bubble** **sizes** **.** **sheet** **laces** with some traction . fresh grassy ester aromas , not too cloying or artificial . lots of apple accompanies the expected banana flavors , fresh but there 's a lack of the spiciness of some . finishes slightly lemony with the requisite loads of aftertaste . as usual , the profile suffers from great water 's tendency to serve its pushed beers too friggin ' cold ( surprising for a brewpub with four cask beers on tap year round ) -- but this is a serviceable hefe in most characteristics .
first off , thanks to brad for openining this one up for us . very generous poured into **a** **tulip** **glass** **a** **golden** **hued** **honey** **color** **with** **a** **slight** **haze** to it . not a whole lot **of** head to speak of though . the aroma is extraordinary and complex with notes of sour fruit , tart , and apple . the taste does not dissappoint . sour apple , tartness , and a subtle oak flovor overwhelm the palate mouthfeel is light . the drinkability of this is exceptional if you get the chance , try this beer . very good
**jackman** **'s** **american** **pale** **ale** **...** **appearance-thick** **orange** **color** **,** little bit of **gold** , thin carbonation and barely any bubbles . smell-sweet hop and malt aroma that is well balanced , alcohol well hidden . taste/mouthfeel-more malty than hoppy but still fairly light , somewhat sweet but fairly balanced , alcohol is well hidden once again . drinkability-your normal pale ale , quite drinkable . overall-an ok apa , i 'm not going to take it out on this one , but i do find myself tiring of the style . still , this beer is fine and well-made , it just does n't separate from the pack .
**poured** from a 12oz . bottle into a tasting glass . **the** **color** **is** **a** **clear** **orange/gold** **with** **a** **finger** **of** **foamy** **white** **head** **and** **some** **slight** **lacing** left on the glass . the smell is a bit hoppy but with malty sweetness that was a bit surprising . there is even a slight spicy flavor that gives a bit of a zing to the nose . the taste is big bitter hop flavor with a good sized alcohol flavor . there is some fruit flavor there that is a little piney flavor mixed in . it is hard to draw on much since there is such a large bitterness there is also some sweet malt flavor that comes out when your able to get past the hops and alcohol . the feel of this beer is big all around . the force of this beer as it mahandles your pallet is something else . i had to take my time with this one . i had a small glass but it still took me a while to get through the little i had . this must be the bitterest beer i have had even though i never did check the ibus .
**batch** **005** **a** **:** **a** **hazy** **yellow** **pear** **color** **,** **the** **head** **is** **a** **nice** **white** **color** **.** **looks** **good** s : strong acidic aroma , vinegar is pretty strong in there as well . there is almost a light citrus thing going on that is nice t : a tart punch hits right away , after the sour fades , there is a slight touch of some funkiness , the finish has a very nice floral note with hints of lemon . very nice m : light on the tongue , tons of carbonation which is mostly comprised of small bubbles o : overall quite lovely , not so burn you tongue sour that you ca n't taste the base beer . there is something so simple , so brilliant about this . it is a quite complex beer , but seems to be so without really trying .
got this at massey hall after seeing the trans-syberian orchestra . **came** **a** **dark** **gold** **,** **autumn** **leaf** **colour** **with** **a** **sliver** **of** **a** **head** . but the bartender poured it improperly . with the glass being a small size , i doubt she could have poured **a** **decent** head on it without it overflowing . barley grain smell . a little sweet , a little weak . kinda bland tasting . sweet , chewy malt , odd aftertaste . it was n't bitter , it was sour ( sour is the best word i could use to describe , and that is n't very close . thin mouthfeel . the chewy malt adds a little texture to the brew . overall , it 's okay . i 've had better , i 've also had worse . but next time i 'm at massey hall , i 'll order a guinness , or maybe a beck 's if i have n't had it already .
**a** **:** **pours** **a** **reddish** **amber** **color** **with** **an** **initial** **one** **finger** **head** **.** **thin** **head** **of** **retention** **left** **after** **the** **initial** **head** **dissipates** **.** **nice** **lacing** . s : sweet malt with a grassy hop presence that balances it out . caramel malt with biscuit like characteristics t/m : sweet caramel malt notes . biscuity malt profile takes over followed by a twang of grassy hops . bitterness is subtle , but still very noticeable . medium body , which is quite nice . smooth and extra soft on the palate -- possibly a tad buttery . d : smooth , soft , tasty , and easily drinkable . solid amber in a can from new england . get a six pack for that next outing on a boat . ca n't go wrong with this one . through the bridge on the merritt from my home town -- support your local brewery
**nothing** **standout-ish** **about** **the** **appearance** **,** **yellow** **with** **some** **gold** **.** **small** **head** . smells of fruit and danger ... hops and grain prominent as well . overall , disarming . hopped to death . can be overwhelming . i would n't mind drinking more , as long as there 's one handy . i would n't move mountains to get another .
**pours** **two** **thick** **fingers** **of** **tan** **froth** on a **dark** **brown** **body** . good nose , with caramel and brown sugar sweetness arising to greet it . the taste blends the sweetness with a dash of hopped bitterness well . well carbonated , this is a sturdy , very drinkable beer that has joined me for much leisure time . i wo n't apologize for that ; nor will you after a couple brown ales .
poured into a bruery tulip glass at about 45 degrees . **pours** **a** **deep** **mahogany** **with** **a** **finger-thick** **off-white** **froth** **...** **nice** **lacing** . on the nose are characteristics of chocolate , citrus , pine , hop flowerm roasted malts , subtle coffee , & dark berries . on the palate , the beer has a nice mouthfeel , definite hope bitterness , long finish with a slight hop astringency . overall a good beer ... i remember when i first had this beer , i did n't like it ... i was not worthy .
**served** **in** **a** **budweiser** **pokal** **.** **pours** **a** **clear** **dark** **amber** **brown** **with** **a** **pale** **oatmeal** **head** **that** **leaves** **a** **good** **amount** **of** **lacing** behind . the smell is lightly roasted malts , with light hints of chocolate , anise , and wheat . the taste brings back those roasted malts , starting off light and becoming increasingly roasted as the taste floods across the tongue . there 's a healthy amount of wheatiness in their as well , not unlike a dunkelweizen with less yeastiness . a slight woddy/nutty quality is also present , but very subdued . the body is on the lighter side and very smooth , allowing this brew to live up to its name .
**pours** **with** **a** **cola-fizzy** **head** **and** **it** **dissipated** **almost** **as** **fast** **.** **nice** **amber** **colored** **body** . the aroma is sweet malt , citrusy hops . flavor is like that of the bastard child of an apa and an esb . a slight sourness to the aroma and flavor . slick moutfeel . basically , they 've taken a pretty run-of-the-mill apa and labeled it as a scottish ale . being not even a really good apa and a horrendous halfassed attempt at a scottish i ca n't give this a very high rating . i will say that it 's not a bad beer , though .
**octoberfest** : **say** the word and you probably think of lederhosen , big **parties** with **communal** tables **,** **beer** **girls** **dressed** **in** **traditional** **garb** **,** **and** **a** brew like this . i sure did so when i saw this available via the single bottle , i figured that this would be a great brew to enjoy the season with , even if i could n't get to a real event like those in germany attend every year . like so many others on here , i was let down by this beer from the moment i poured it out . i know that marzens are n't the highest rated brews on here , but i do expect an imported offering like this to have some taste , body , and drinkability to it light pour to this was **a** **good** **head** **and** **lacing** that was better than expected . those were the best aspects of this beer as the aroma was practically **nonexistent** **and** **the** **head** **faded** fairly quickly . marzen 's tend to be a bit thin in the mouthfeel for me but even this did n't match up to my less-than-lofty expectations . there was straw , grass , and floral notes to this beer but i could n't wonder how much of the taste had to do with the green bottle . sure enough , this tasted skunked as soon as i took a sip and because this had n't been on the shelf that long , i think that spoke more about the beer than the presentation of it . further tasting of this led me to wonder what style it was , since it reminded me of an adjunct lager in every aspect . the filler seemed less than up to standards and the aftertaste was sour enough to beg for a chaser - any type that would alleviate the lingering and uneasy bitterness i have no idea how something this bad could be so strong in the alcohol department . this is not the kind of beer i would want to get drunk on and even though the carbonation did n't detract from the taste , this was n't something that i could down very quickly . maybe i 'm not up to snuff on my appreciation of this style but after seeing how low this was rated on here , i 'm thinking that this beer is about a big a letdown as they get .
12 oz silver foiled bottle . 5.7 % alc . pours **god** 's **gold** , **an** **incredibly** **clear** **,** **bright** **color** **that** **looks** **alot** like a piece of gold when in the dimpled mug **.** **the** **head** is large **,** **white** **,** **and** **foamy** **and** **sticks** for awhile . it smells very clean but robust for the style . it is very bready with not much sign of hops . it is quite sweet with a subtle fruitiness , the grains are sweet as well . not much in the way of hops , just a minuscule amount of bitterness . if you want a lesson in non bitter but still refreshing beer this is it . if it did n't have so much flavor it would be a rousing success in the us . the drinkability is at high levels
**a** **:** **crystal** **clear** **amber** **,** **rim** **of** **bubbles** **,** **minimal** **lace** . s : strong musty funk , very chemical like nail polish , paint thinner , motor oil , granny smith apples , hard cider . t : like biting into a lemon ... that 's full of stomach acid . waves of funk and sourness , first on the tongue , then the rest of your palate and throat catches up and you get a second shock on the swallow and aftertaste . my initial unconscious reaction is to spit it out , like my mouth is saying 'you should n't be drinking this ! by the time i 'm able to right myself and convince my throat to swallow i 'm already regretting it . but like vegetables , anchovies and many other things i 've grown -- and learned -- to like ( or even love ) , i can already feel this one growing on me . still , it is like what i imagine the acid blood of the alien alien would taste like before it melted you face off . m : light body and carbonation , very sharp and crisp with a bone dry finish . d : not my favorite gueze experience so far , and though i 've definitely had more drinkable guezes , or at least ones i prefer , i 'm also new to this style i feel it 's important to hold off passing judgement until i 've accustomed my palate to these beers . what i will say though is that this beer gave me heartburn .
**appears** **a** **hazy** **,** **dark** **auburn** **with** **a** **small** **,** **light** **tan** **head** **that** **quickly** **fades** into a **mild** **cap** **and** **collar** **.** **spotty** **bits** **of** **lacing** are left around the glass . smell is of toasted nuts , cocoa , caramel , and fresh bread . taste is of coffee , toasted nuts , cocoa , caramel , baked bread , and a touch of figs . mouthfeel is medium bodied , spritzy up front , and smooth in the finish .
**throws** **a** **chill-hazed** **golden** **.** **thin** **white** **head** **retreats** to **virtually** **nothing** **immediately** **,** **but** **leaves** **some** **nice** lace work down the side of the glass . hoppy nose with citric notes . pleasant , but not alot to speak of . taste begins with the hops . definately herbal . a light , but solid malt base keeps things in check , leaning slightly in the carmel direction . hops reappearing to mop up at the finish . leaving some tea-like notes and some lemon twang . fairly light bodied . very drinkable and refreshing . leaps and bounds better than their hefeweizen . this is a solid offering . thanks , bighuge
**poured** from the bottle into a lindemans ' **flute** glass . the small glass aided **in** **producing** **a** **large** **three** **finger** **pink** **head** **over** a **deep** **red** body straight up raspberry aroma . not too surprising , but fairly powerful . of course , raspberry flavor , but also nice and tart . a little funky yeast blends in as well . very sweet . very easy to drink for the low abv . high carbonation . will not be a regular , but my wife loves it .
**a** **-** **amber/orangish** **with** **a** **decent** **sized** **off-white** **head** **.** s - malty and caramel/toffee with very slight hints of fruit . classical british smells in pale ales . t - caramel and toffee along with very slight nuttiness are the main flavors . there is some buttery taste as well . slight apple and honey . the normal british flavors of caramel/toffee/bready but a little lackluster and watery . m - fairly light and thin but also quite smooth . d - easy to drink and nothing offensive , a lot like a lot of british beers in terms of sessionability ( however the flavor does n't quite match some of those great british session beers ) . notes : this is one of those beers that is a good stepping stone and introduction . shows off the typical flavors that you think of in british beers , just not as well as some other good ones .
2007 bottle served in **a** **trappist** glass . **somewhat** **of** **a** **cloudy** **brown** **pour** **with** **a** **thin** **tan** **colored** **head** . aroma is fruity and alcoholic in a familiar belgian fashion . flavor is sweet up front with a tart fruity middle , you can taste the cherries , and finishes with a dry mildly roasted flavor that is rather nice . not too shaby .
**poured** from a bottle into a pint glass . a **:** **pours** **a** **ruby** **amber** **color** **with** **1/4** **'** **thin** **head** **and** **some** **lacing** . this is a good looking beer . s : floral hops and citrus burst into the nostrils . some slight malt and pine aromas also present . t : sweet citrus flavors dominate the initial sip followed by a significant hop presence in the middle to finish . some slightly unappealing bitter aftertaste in the finish . m : this beer has the feel of a good spring beer . it is light and thin on the tongue with the presence of prickly carbonation . overall this is a good beer . it is very similar in flavor to nugget nectar , but the flavors and character are not as prominent as in its imperial amber ale cousin . aside from the slightly bitter aftertaste , the beer is well balanced and one of the tastier amber ales that i have had .
**1/29/2007** **pours** **a** **very** **dark** **brown** **with** **a** **thin** **,** **off-white** **,** **mostly** **diminishing** **head** . the aroma is that of raisin , plum , clove , cinnamon , nutmeg , and brown sugar . there may be a hint of spruce and earth . it has a nice , full mouth feel with small , soft bubbles . the flavor is moderately sweet with lingering alcohol and prunes . this is very much like trois pistoles but a bit more refined , a bit sweeter , a thicker texture and more focused flavor . it has the dark sweet flavor of prunes and raisins but the flavor does n't explode the way trois pistoles does . it kept me warm on a snowy night .
**tangerine** **pour** **with** **a** **small** **white** **head** **that** **clings** to the edge of the glass . the aroma is comprise mostly of soapy , resiny hops - far from a punch in the face of west coast bitterness , and not all that impressive compared to others within the style . malty flavour and not all that hop-oriented . the hopping is smooth and mild , but the bitterness does gradually build , although it reminded me more of an english bitter instead of an american ipa . the malts come out as fruity with some honey . medium-light body with decent carbonation . i ca n't give it a glowing review because its not a great beer . pyramid seems to be very hit and miss , and this is a miss . inspite of this , it still makes a damn drinkable beer and beats the living crap out of the major brands . thanks mark
**the** **presentation** **was** **nothing** **bold** **,** **the** **beer** was **black** - no question about it , **but** **lacked** **a** **good** **decent** **finger** **of** **head** **.** **the** **head** **was** **minimal** **and** **light** **tan** . smell was average for any other brewpub stout you might imagine . super dark roasted malt . taste was better then i thought it would be . very smooth drink with a bite during the finish , a certain spice that i could n't place but was very direct and i just burped another taste of it ( two hours later ) . average on everything else . this is a standard stout and i really do n't desire another .
**appearance** **-** **a** **murky** **caramel/brown** brew . **extremely** **bubbly** **,** three fingers at least . fades back to a half-finger and holds there due to quite a bit of bead from underneath . aroma - powdery , grainy malts , not much more . taste - decent malts to start . a little sourish tasting but a bit of toast too . a mild brown sugar taste that comes across kind of funky . after a few sips , the malty side begins to dominate . the swallow has a nice abv warmth in the throat . mouthfeel - way too bubbly , interferes with the flavor , inhibiting the sweetness . i like the smoothness , though , and it has a good body on it . drinkability - not my favorite bock , but it drinks okay .
**a** **-** **poured** **black** **with** **an** **awesome** **,** **creamy** **head** s - smells of burnt malts , and that 's about it . t - burnt malts dominate ... nothing else was really going on with it . not bad , but not good . m - full bodied and smooth . nice mouthfeel . d - the burnt malts overpower , making this a very one-dimensional brew . it got kind of boring after a while , however it was good enough for me to finish a pitcher so it was n't too bad .
**good** **and** **rich** . poured well into **the** glass **with** **a** **rich** **brown** **color** **and** **nice** **thick** **head** **.** **good** **steady** **carbonation** **.** **good** **lacing** down the glass . rich toffee aroma . the taste was sweet . a bit too sweet for my taste but good nevertheless . a tinge from the abv felt at the finish . suckem up and movem out .
**a** **-** **pours** **dark** **brown** **to** **black** **,** **thick** **off** **white** **head** **.** **thin** **soapy** **lacing** . s - light coffee and toasted malt - kinda earthy . t - nice toastly malt , a little smoke , coffee , light cocoa . m - thin , but expected for style . good balance and carb . d - very drinkable for style .
12oz bottle poured into a **dfh** **snifter** glass **a** : **pours** **a** **ruby/orange** **color** **with** **a** **one** **finger** **head** **that** **dissipated** **quickly** **leaving** **a** **little** **bit** **of** **foam** on **the** **top** **.** **decent** **lacing** down the sides s : nice citrusy hops , lots of grapefruit on this one . get a hint oh booze on the nose as well t : fell a little flat compared to the nose . not has hopcentric as i was expecting . the hops are still there , but it is a whole lot weaker . just average imo m/d : medium bodied . overall it was fine , but nothing special for me .
had this on tap at instant replay , review from notes a : served in a standard pint glass **,** **the** **beer** **pours** **a** **clear** **straw** **yellow** **color** **with** **slight** **golden** **hue** **.** **the** **white** **head** **rose** **about** **a** **good** **inch** **in** a **half** **,** **but** **quickly** **settled** **,** **leaving** **minimal** **lacing** s : scents of hops , a bit of lemon zest , grass , some mild wheat and malt in the background too t : initial flavor impression is a crisp , medium bitter bite , followed by a mild wheat malt backbone . some citrus , light herbs and hops , but overall just simple and refreshing m : medium body , crisp , with medium to high carbonation o : session beer for me . decent flavor , not to high in alcohol , refreshing , and goes down very easy , and fast on a hot day . however , being an american pale ale , it is light in flavors too , and not something , personally , that i would seek out per se when craving an alesmith beer , as so much of their other offerings offer a lot more complexity as well as flavor in my opinion . prefer speedway stout , or nautical nut brown when given their options . as for the this beer in style , good , but only above average for me .
**small** **somewhat** **creamy** **light** **brown** **head** **that** **mostly** **diminished** **.** **pitch** **black** **color** **.** aroma of bread , molasses , caramel , chocolate , coffee , toasted malt . light alcoholic sniff , plum , prune , date , licorice . very complex aroma . full bodied with an alcoholic texture and a soft carbonation . excellent balance between the moderated sweet malt and bitter flavor . berries sweet and lingering finish . smooth and very nice thick beer . definitely one of my favorite ris .
**a** **-** **cloudy** **yellow-orange** . s - spicy citrus , wheat , cloves and a graininess . t - impressive flavours in this . wheaty twang , spiciness , yeast , citrus flavours meld well m - light and refreshing . not too carbonated nor heavy . d - very good . tons of flavour without weighing down the mouthfeel , or being over-the-top .
**celebration** was poured into **a** **tulip** **glass** **.** **appearance-** **the** **head** is almost **silky** and is about one and **a** **half** **fingers** **of** **off-white** **with** **a** **yellow** **tinge** . **this** **one** **leaves** **great** **sheets** **of** **pillowy** **lace** . the body is the color of **orange** **rind** **with** **amber** **highlights** . smell- the hop notes are estery and have a touch of floral to them . there is some slight citrus backed up by a sweet caramel malt . it smells great , but it is a little too subdued . taste- the hop bitterness is really great on this one and lasts throughout the drink . there is some sweeter biscuit malt accompanied with citrus and grassy hop flavors . it is a refreshing ipa . mouth feel- this one borders on a light and medium body . it certainly is not the creamiest ipa out there by any stretch of the imagination overall- this is a good ipa that i would recommend to anyone . the main thing to adjust would be the mouth feel by fixing the carbonation up , also get those great hop notes to really show up on the palate . the malt character is nice , but getting more of that floral hop in the flavor , for instance , would only help this ipa 's score .
**a** **fierce** **sound** **,** **clearly** **heralding** **something** **good** , or at least , **we** **hope** **...** **hazy** **golden** **hue** **,** **fervent** carbonation , with **a** **huge** **,** **creamy** **white** **head** **atop** **,** **very** **attractive** . citrus and spice in the nose , very bold and bright and uplifting with flavor ... pepper and clove , coriander , lemon zest ... like a witbier with a bit more cojones ... taste is fully flavored , juicy , zesty , spicy , brisk , bristling , brilliant ... with a certain sugary kick ... a little candy-ish , treacly , sticky-sweet ... but i ca n't help but like it..medium-bodied , a trifle thin , actually , ..but still good ... .a very nice tripel , if un-trancesdental . awully tasty , zesty , sweet ... and a little bit strong , ... this lands in the good category , and that 's very fine .
**a** **-** **pours** **out** **jet** **black** **with** **no** **head** **.** **no** **lacing** either . s - smelled like cofffee , actually not just coffee but fresh ground coffee beans . t - obviously it tasted like coffee m - it was soft on the tongue and medium-bodied . d - i really am not a huge fan of coffee ( mostly because i do n't like hot drinks ) . i expected the coffee taste to be more subtle . that being said i actually liked the beer .
**poured** from a 11.2 oz bottle into a **chimay** **chalice** . **appearance** **:** **pours** **a** **hazy** **dark** **brown** **color** **with** **reddish** **hues** **around** **the** **laces** . **has** **a** **thick** **white** **head** **that** **dissipates** **slowly** **and** **leaves** **little** **lacing** . smell : smells strongly of dark fruits and sweet malts . has that belgian yeasty smell too . taste : has a strong vinous taste . starts bitter and vinous and finishes sweet and spicy . has a noticeable alcohol flavor as well . mouthfeel : very smooth and full-bodied with a nice carbonation bite . drinkability : another great beer from chimay . the chimay line-up is one of the best in the world of beer . certainly worth a try and something i will look for in the future .
2/13/05- on tap at **a** pub in bozeman , mt . **presentation-** from the tap into **a** tumbleweed ipa **glass** **.** **appearance-** **amber** **pour** **with** **a** **nice** **3/4** **inch** **thick** **creamy** **head** **,** **and** **nice** **lacing** **.** **smell-** nice typical ipa scent . fairly heavy pine and grapefruit scents . taste- nice flavor balance between the hops and the malt . more grapefruit flavor than pine . not to bitter . mouthfeel- good carbonation level . drinkability- a very drinkable ipa . not the best , but definitely above average . good balnaced brew that i would try again when in montana .
**another** **stone** on tap..this one has proven to **not** be **as** **uneven** as **some** **of** **the** **other** **styles** **.** **lovely** **dark** **shade** **,** very dark ... you can pick up some reddish/brown when held to the light . **very** **nice** **head** when poured , plus it **left** **lots** **of** **lovely** **lacing** through-out the glass . light smokey aroma . nice chewey , medium bodied beer . this is one of their more balanced beers in my opinion , and it shows , the malt and hops blend well together , neither overshadowing the other . there 's some roasted flavor present in the malt as well . it leaves a smooth smokey aftertaste that is pleasurable . pretty good brew . not as smokey as some german smoke beers , so might be a way to introduce this flavor to someone
**poured** this one from a growler filled at deschutes early evening based upon the suggestion of a pub server . i would n't have grabbed this otherwise -- i 'm glad he took the time to push me towards a good choice armory xpa **is** **a** **predominantly** **reddish** **amber** **brew** **with** **a** **moderate** **head** **and** **minimum** **lacing** . the scent on this one is fantastic , ranging from ripe banana , fresh cut grasses , and sweet toffee . it 's definitely treading towards an ipa with the citrus and pine profile , though the bitter hops are slightly more subdued in this one compared many of the pacnw ipa 's , softened by a tangerine-like sweetness . this is a great summer drinking option , light going down , with substantial carbonation . overall , i 'm definitely glad to have tried armory xpa , though i should caveat that if someone is looking for a profile that strays far at all from a pacnw ipa , they had best look elsewhere .
the '05 gabf winner **...** **appears** **a** **copper** **toned** **amber** **with** **a** **lush** **ivory** **white** **head** **that** **sticks** around **.** **tons** **of** **lacing** cling to the interior of the glass . smell is of a rich malt with toffee , hard candy , bitter hops , along with a sugary sweetness . taste is about the same of the aroma with a nice hop addition . mouthfeel is chewy , bitter , sweet , and semi-dry . this is a great rendition . one of the best american versions i 've had .
**pours** **a** **tarnished** **amber** **,** large **carbonation** **bubbles** **,** **and** **a** **giant** **rocky** **offwhite** **head** **.** smells like bubblegum , cherries , and bread . there is also a wine smell , like what you would smell if you left a red wine bottle open for a few weeks with just a little bit in the bottom , kind of like wine yeast , i guess wow , that taste is all about that weird wine flavour . sweet , lingering aftertaste of double-bubble bubblegum . wow , that upfront wacky flavour is really right there . it reminds me of the weird flavour in three floyds gumballhead mouthfeel is alright , a bit overcarbonated for my liking , but it does well to reinforce the wine/champagne aspects of this beer . this beer speaks for itself , if you like this style , you are going to get it , as it 's a bit of a classic .
**a** **:** **jet** **black** **,** **with** **red** **hues** trying to peek through , but hard to capture , unless directly in the light . **thick** **,** **creamy** **,** **dark** **tan** **head** **,** **good** **lacing** . s : coffee up front , then one has to search for the bourbon , kind of disappointing , but still great scents . some nice chocolaty hints , along with vanilla . t : huge roasted malts , but matched with a fudge-chocolate sweetness . strong coffee presence , as the nose would lead on , then comes the delicious woody notes ; hints of vanilla . the bourbon is very much in the background , but the rest of the flavors are excellent . m : medium body , not too thick , but pretty smooth and almost creamy . no sign of alcohol in this beer . o/d : it 's a beer i wish i could have more of , but at the same time ... it did not live up to the hype . it 's delicious , but where 's the bourbon
**``** **this** **has** **a** **beautiful** **,** **big** **,** **foamy** **white** **head** **and** **lots** **of** **lace** . '' it is dark , but see through . reddish brown **in** color . there 's a very nice malty scent mixed with grape . scent/look best parts of this brew . this is essentially a soft tasting ale . it has a dry taste with a bit of a dark fruit aftertaste . it 's also quite malty . there 's a bit of a tart mouthfeel . it 's smooth , definitely not heavy , but a bit dry .
into **a** **pint** glass **,** **poured** **a** **solid** **black** **,** **not** **so** **much** **head** but **enough** **,** **tannish** **in** **color** **,** **decent** **lacing** down the glass . as for aroma , if you love coffee and beer , its the best of both worlds , a very fresh strong full roast coffee blended with ( and almost overtaking ) a solid , classic stout nose , with the toasty , chocolate malts . with the taste , its even more coffee , and while its my dream come true , so delicious , what with its nice chocolate and burnt malt tones again , but i almost say it overtakes any stoutiness , and takes away from the beeriness of this beer . which is n't to say it is n't delicious , because it is , just seems a bit unbalanced . oh well ! the mouth is pretty solid , a bit light but not all that unexpected with a coffee blend . its fairly smooth , not quite creamy , well carbonated , thoroughly , exceptionally drinkable .
**simply** **the** **best** **dark** **beer** i 've found -- for my taste . much better than their porter . i 've brewed and purchased **countless** **stouts** . the only thing close has been a stout that i brew with a pound of **honey** and lager yeast . **obsidian** **stout** is best when a little warm ( 55 degrees ) . i usually drink it out of a glass that i got at the guinness brewery in dublin
spending my day off catching up on some old reviews . the stack is pretty massive , just now getting around to winter beers . free sample from my lh rep . wish i could remember his name , but this was at least 6 months ago and i have n't seen the guy since . **dark** **brown** **body** . the aroma is all spice : nutmeg and coriander , not a good start . on the palate malt and hops take a back seat to spices . nutmeg forcefully controls this beer . no balance , just the baking spices that have unfortunately come to define too many winter offerings . the body was smooth and creamy , but this spice bomb was a drain pour for me . maybe its just my personal preferences , but this seemed completely out of balance and was not enjoyable .
**ver** **clear** **golden** **straw** **color** **,** **foamy** **head** **dissapates** **quickly** . when yeast is added in it swirls thickly througout the glass , turning the beer a murky lemon-tealike color.beautiful appearance . very granny-smith like taste , orange bitterness , co riander comes though , very tart , more biting and less sweet than expected , like extra dry champange , a difference that i apreciated.very very good , i liked how special this beer tasted , good go-to aeritif
**received** **in** a trade with mrtopher . thanks **chris** **a** **-** **pours** **a** **hazy** **amber** **color** **with** **thin** **off-white** **head** **.** **the** **head** **dissipates** **relatively** **quickly** , but a few bubbles remain on top of the beer and a fair **amount** **of** **lacing** is left on the glass . s - intense citrus hop aroma balanced with some sweet caramel maltiness . t - starts with some pineapple along with some other citrus fruits . a very slight pine bitterness is noticeable for a brief second before some bready malts take over . excellent tasting dipa that is very easy to drink . m - slightly about average body with a perfect amount of carbonation . exactly what i would expect from a dipa . overall , a solid dipa . i do n't think it does anything to set itself apart from the other beers of the style , but you certainly ca n't go wrong with this easy drinking brew from drake 's .
served from the bottle into a **becker** **glass** **a-poured** **a** **semi-hazy** **orange** **color** **with** **a** **one** **finger** **soapy** **head** **s-** very sweet floral , slightly citrusy aroma . smells like a clean pale ale t- very sweet floral taste , come citrus and herbal notes . finishes with a strong bitterness ( a non-nondescript bitterness ) . kind of faint in flavor . m- medium body , pretty high carbonation , pretty clean o- a clean ipa that reminds me more of a pale ale . the strong nondescript bitterness brings this beer down for me some , just not very flavorful either . not worth picking up , much better ipas out there .
**a** : poured into a **sierra** **nevada** **anniversary** **ale** **pint** **glass** **.** **body** **is** **clear** **golden** **with** **a** **1-finger** **ivory-white** **head** . very little in the way of visible carbonation , and what bubbles there are are slow to **rise** **.** **leaves** **good** **splotchy** **lace** s : very nice - tropical fruit , apricot and a touch of pine . may be a hint of cat pee too , so i knocked it down to 4 , ultimatley ; at first i thought 4.5 - 5 t : follows the nose , pretty much : tropical fruit ( pineapple ) , citrus ( grapefruit peel and lemon ) and apricot . reminds me at first blush of sculpin , but there 's a bit of spice at the finish , and some heat on the way down ( not terribly surprising given the 7.85 % abv ) , that distinguishes this one from sculpin . finishes with lingering spice , pine resin and tropical fruit m : given the light color , this one 's heavier in heft than anticipated - call it medium in weight ( also another area of difference with sculpin , which i keep coming back to due to that apricot taste and light coloring ) . slight slickness to the feel . o : good stuff . ventures away from the usual piney/citrusy hop bitterness and towards the apricot/tropical fruit taste ( and smell ) . nice surprise from lagunitas on that front .
11.2oz bottle poured into **a** **tulip** glass . best by 22/08/12 . **appearance** **:** **clear** **golden** **yellow** **with** **lots** of bubbles moving up through the beer **.** **initial** **rocky** **white** **head** **(** **1/8** **'** **thick** **)** **with** **some** **thin** **strands** **of** **lacing** here and there , **but** **the** head is almost all gone by the end of the glass and so is **the** lacing , but i 'm really enjoying the color smell : yeast and fresh orange peel , but as the beer warms up the smell really diminishes taste : bready malt , yeast again , and a citric orange mild bitter finish . the finish starts to take on some more herbal and spicy notes as the beer warms up but the citric orange still dominates mouthfeel : good carbonation - cleanses the palate but does n't scour it . just a bit thick , but smooth overall / drinkability : nice and tasty . simple and straightforward , and a great looking beer to stare at while savoring . a solid good beer and i could easily see myself having another one .
**pours** **a** **light-ish** **golden** **brown** **,** **with** **a** **nice** **cream** **colored** **head** **.** **fair** **retention** **,** **lacing** . smells good , but does n't quite smell like a doppelbock . faint malt with black tea , nondescript sweet fruits , alcohol tingle on a very deep whiff . taste is again good , but not what you expect in a bottle labeled doppelbock . a nice sweet maltiness up front , but with a strong piney and earthy hop presence . a little breadiness and green apple in the middle , a bit of alcohol tingle and a dry finish . relatively light body , but a lively feeling carbonation . i am torn , i really like this brew , but as a doppelbock it is a disappointment . without the style in mind i would rate this much higher . i will give drinkability a 5 , because it is good , just dont expect a doppelbock like you have experienced before .
**this** **poured** **a** **nearly** **opaque** **dark** **mahogany** **with** **a** **little** **light** **tan** **head** . it smelled like light roasted barley with faint lemon hops and chocolate and smoke . it tasted like copper hops and burnt barley , with some bready yeast and lemon and a bit of dark chocolate . it was watery with moderate carbonation , and had a bitter aftertaste . overall this was n't very clean or tasty , with a weak scent and mediocre body . that all adds up to a disappointing beer that i would n't recommend unless you 're desperate to try another schwarzbier .
**pours** **a** **white** **one** **finger** **head** **that** **dissipates** **moderately** **quickly** . **crystal** **clear** **straw** **body** , with a small amount of visible carbonation . slightly sweet corn scent . unremarkable taste . light on the hoppiness , does n't bring much to the palate . pretty one dimensional , but that 's pretty expected for an extra pale ale . very light watery mouthfeel , but not very crisp . goes down with very little trace . if you 're in the mood for a super light session beer that 's not too boring then this might be a better compromise than some of the other similar aals out there .
**semi** **opaque** **burnt** **orange** **pour** in a tulip **.** **thick** **,** **lump** **head** **dissipated** **pretty** **quickly** **.** **looks** like a classic sn ... **beautiful** for about 30 seconds , then well , messy . spicy and very bright and floral in the nose ( high grade marijuana buds ) with malts present in the background . dried fruits and spices ... big fruity hops are abundant . earthy and grainy , the barley malts add a depth that surround the huge amount of hops beautifully . pine nuts and a tangy finish . dense , oily feel foamy on the tongue . this beer is really good . it really has the depth and hops of a double ipa . this is a well named brew . tastes and feels like a harvest . pairs nicely with turkey and cranberry salad . this is my second bottle this autumn and hope to have more
**not** **a** **great** **beer** **,** **but** **not** **bad** **.** **pours** **with** **a** **nice** **foamy** **frothy** **off** **white** **head** **that** **lasts** **and** **a** **little** **lace** . color is an ever so **slightly** **hazy** **amber** . aroma is malty , grassy , hoppy , and bready beer . flavor 's very similar along with pretzels and with bitterness coming out at the end . good body and carbonation . finish is good . drinkable beer . could be a session .

thanks to blake ( kickinthechalice ) for **this** **beer** **appearance** **:** **pours** **a** **golden** **yellowish-orange** **color** **-** **almost** **like** the stone soup beer ( which i just drank and reviewed ) except that it seems less **dense** **and** **more** **translucent** **.** **the** **head** is **fizzy** and maybe **half** **a** finger 's worth **...** **it** **dissipates** **quickly** but the bubbles keep streaming up from the bottom aroma : smells like malts and wheat , maybe a little fruitiness in the background . between the pour and the aroma , this is shaping up to be a lot like stone soup , which i hope it is n't , because i did n't love that . this is a cream ale though , while stone soup is a belgian pale ... not sure why they appear so similar so far taste/mouthfeel : feels creamy in the mouth . thank god , unlike stone soup , i 'm not getting any strong lingering after taste - that 's totally not my thing . spotted cow feels very light and thin , which here is n't bad ... . to be honest , the flavor is n't very full , so i 'm having a difficult time rating it . i guess i mostly taste pale malts with a little hops notes : this beer is light and crisp and the drinkability is high . it 's nothing too special though , just a nice drinking beer , maybe best on a hot afternoon .
**honeymoon** **saison** **is** **a** **golden** **colored** **brew** **,** **with** **a** **medium-sized** **fluffy** **white** **head** **which** **sticks** to your glass . the scent is sweet , with some honey , yeasty , candy , spiciness , some clove , maybe a touch of apple . taste starts light and sweet , bit of honey with lots of spicy pepper , clove , some fruit notes , orange and lemon , maybe a touch of apple . very spicy aftertaste , just a touch of sourness , slight tartness . medium bodied .
**darkish** **straw** **colored** **,** **clear** **,** slightly **carbonated** **,** **medium** **head** **,** **decent** **lacing** . smell is more sweet than hoppy , not very piney . the hops come out in the taste , but they 're not overwhelming . balanced nicely with a mellow tea-ish flavor . feels light and crisp in the mouth . quite drinkable . i had this for the first time in 2008 and enjoyed it , so i made a point to find it again this year . this review is for the 2009 release of esb .
**wrong** glassware : pint for **a** **weizen** **.** **hazy** **orange** **color** **,** **less** **than** **an** **inch** **of** **head** . the smell is wheat and fresh hay ; citrus fruits in background ( citron ? ) , and orange peel , strong . the taste is very citric ( too much ) , and a little hint of banana . there is a bitter orange-like bitterness . not vert thirst-quenching ( and it is a weizen ) . medium-low body . in the aftertaste mre lemony and citric again . very peculiar for a weizen , but i do n't like it . at a second taste , the few classic weizen characteristics disappear , and remains just the bitterness . not very drinkable .
big thanks to alexgash from ba **for** **the** **bottle** **cloudy** **orange** **colored** **pour** **with** **a** **big** **lasting** **meringue** **like** **head** **.** thick **wheaty** , banana flavor with lots of clovey yeast smell too . very big strong hef smell with a light lemony wheatiness as well . taste is strong and full bodied with the same flavors . very good quality hefeweizen but just a style i 'm style growing to like slowly .
**a** beer that is not sold in my neck of the woods , but managed to get while on a roadtrip . poured into an **imperial** **pint** **glass** **with** **a** **generous** **head** **that** **sustained** **life** throughout . nothing out of the ordinary here , but a damn good brew still . body was kind of heavy , but not thick . the hop smell was excellent and enticing . very drinkable
12 ounce bottle poured into my stone tulip **.** **pours** **a** **deep** **reddish** **brown** **,** very pretty . **a** **nice** **three** **finger** **layer** **of** **frothy** **head** **that** **settles** down into a one **inch** **layer** **.** **lots** **of** **lacing** all around the inside of the glass smell is great too , lots of pine , fruit , malt , and a distinct hop , taste follows through , very bitter and first , but not so much as it continues to set in on the tongue . this beer is not dominated by the hops ; there is an enormous malt presence here alcohol is too high to make this extremely drinkable , but that just goes with the style . still , a damn tasty and impressive beer from weyerbacher .
